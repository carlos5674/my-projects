The man, Daniel Ramirez Medina, has twice been granted deferred action and employment authorization under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, his lawyers said. The program, announced in 2012, is meant to temporarily shield qualified individuals from deportation. The case raises questions about what it could mean for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Ramirez came to the US from Mexico when he was 7 years old and became a DACA recipient in 2014 and renewed in 2016, according to court papers filed by his attorneys. Immigration rights groups say they believe this may be the first time a Dreamer has been arrested without cause. Ramirez\\u2019s lawyers have filed suit in federal court saying their client is being unlawfully held by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. \\u201cThe federal government may not arbitrarily or capriciously deprive DACA recipients of these benefits, as they have here with Mr. Ramirez,\\u201d his lawyers wrote in briefs filed in court.

It creates a new criminal offense in the Criminal Code of \\u201cenabling illegal immigration,\\u201d which is defined to include helping asylum seekers who are \\u201cnot eligible for protection,\\u201d as well as to include border monitoring, producing and disseminating information, or \\u201cnetwork building.\\u201d If committed \\u201cregularly,\\u201d or with the aim of \\u201chelp[ing] several persons,\\u201d the offense would be considered aggravated.
