88	8	Germany deports 69 failed asylum-seekers to Afghanistan: BERLIN (AP) — German authorities say they have deported 69 Afghans whose asylum requests were rejected back to their home country. A plane carrying the men from Munich to Kabul landed in the Afghan capital early Wednesday. It was one of the largest collective deportation flights yet organized by Germany, which has vowed to step up the removal of people who don't have a right to remain in the country. The state interior minister of Bavaria, where 51 of the men had been living, welcomed the deportation flight. Joachim Herrmann noted that unlimited deportations to Afghanistan had recently been approved by Germany's federal authorities. In recent years deportations to Afghanistan were limited to people with criminal convictions.

The U.S. Border Patrol said in a statement Monday that the immigrants were discovered Friday at a checkpoint on U.S. 83, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Laredo in South Texas. The semitrailer stopped in the checkpoint's primary lane where the driver, a U.S. citizen, was questioned about his immigration status. His rig was kept for further inspection, and agents found the immigrants inside the trailer. The immigrants are from Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Thirteen were unaccompanied minors. The Border Patrol says all of them are in good health. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Nina Pruneda says the driver's identity and other details about the case are being withheld at this time.

428	5	21,000 Undocumented Immigrants Arrested in First Weeks of Trump Presidency, Including 5,400 Non-Criminals: The number of undocumented immigrant arrests rose by roughly one-third in the first weeks of the Trump administration, largely driven by an increase in the number of non-criminals arrested. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement removal authorities made 21,362 arrests from January 20 to March 13 of this year, including 5,441 non-criminals, according to statistics provided to CNN and first requested by The Washington Post. While the arrests by ICE under President Donald Trump in the first seven weeks of his administration still lag behind the number arrested under former President Barack Obama in the same timeframe in 2014, the pace of arrests this year do mark an escalation compared to the last two years of the Obama administration, when the Democrat used greater discretion toward undocumented immigrants. The increase in arrests — including more than double the number of non-criminal indviduals — stands as further evidence of the Trump administration’s priority of enforcing immigration laws more aggressively than the previous administration and giving immigration officials greater authority to go after a wide range of undocumented immigrants. The more than 21,000 arrested in the beginning of this year is a roughly 33% increase over the same period in 2016 and a roughly 18% increase over the same period in 2015.
364	4	"Once Routine, ICE Check-Ins Now Fill Immigrants In U.S. Illegally With Anxiety: Florinda Lorenzo has been in the U. S. illegally for more than a decade but checks in with federal immigration agents in Baltimore several times a year. Until recently, it had become routine, almost like a trip to the dentist. Many immigrants — like Lorenzo — who are here illegally are not in hiding. Hundreds of thousands of them report to U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on a regular basis. They've been allowed to stay because past administrations considered them a low priority for deportation. But with the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, that once-routine check-in has become a nerve-wracking experience. In recent weeks, some immigrants say they've been detained without warning at their ICE check-ins. ""It creates a lot of chaos for me,"" Lorenzo says through an interpreter. ""I know lots of people are getting deported now, and I wouldn't want to be deported. "" Lorenzo came to the U. S. from Guatemala 14 years ago. She has three children, two of them U. S. citizens who were born here. Lorenzo was arrested in 2010 and charged with selling prepaid phone cards without a license. The charges were dropped, but she's been required to check in with ICE since then."
197	6	"California becomes first 'sanctuary state' for undocumented migrants: Los Angeles (AFP) - California became the first ""sanctuary state"" for undocumented immigrants Friday, a decision criticized by the Trump administration which believes the move will compromise security. California's governor, Democrat Jerry Brown, signed the landmark legislation -- Senate Bill 54 (SB54) -- which grants better protections to people who are in the US without permission, including those who have committed crimes. It also limits cooperation between local police forces and federal authorities in operations to track down undocumented immigrants. The legislation, which will come into effect on January 1, 2018, is part of a series of laws which protect the almost 3 million undocumented immigrants living in California -- most of whom are from Mexico and Central America. Brown insisted in his signing statement the measure will not ""prevent or prohibit Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or the Department of Homeland Security from doing their own work in any way"" -- but it will stop local authorities from assisting."

""We are very disappointed by some of the actions by the US administration,"" the commerce and industry minister told reporters here.

The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. Prabhu said under the visas issued to the technology service providers, there is evidence that Indians have contributed significantly to the growth of the US economy. Indian companies' investment into the US has created newI jobs in America, he said, adding that if spouses of the Indian IT professionals are competent and qualified, they will only add value to the economy there and not snatch jobs of local people. The Trump administration is planning to end giving work permits to the spouses of H1-B visa holders to work legally in the US, a move that could have a devastating impact on tens of thousands of Indians."

The statement follows a series of reports accusing Ken Isaacs of prejudice against Islam, AFP reported. Isaacs has a long record of humanitarian work with the Christian charity Samaritan’s Purse and within George W. Bush’s presidential administration. He has been nominated by the US State Department to head the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The official is in Geneva trying to rally support for his candidacy ahead of a June vote in which the IOM’s 169 member states will choose their next director-general.

The candidacy has been complicated by reports detailing incidents where Isaacs apparently tweeted or retweeted material offensive to Muslims. “After talking to me for a minute or two and hearing who I am, what I talk about, what my heart is,” questions about prejudice vanish, he said.
55	5	"Hungarian govt looks to Constitution to keep immigrants out: BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — The Hungarian government proposed constitutional amendments and a new law Tuesday that are intended to prevent Hungary ""from becoming an immigrant country"" by further tightening its policies on accepting refugees and asylum-seekers. The law submitted to parliament would make it a criminal offense punishable by up to a year in prison to promote or facilitate ""illegal migration. "" Dubbed ""Stop Soros"" by the government, it partly targets civic groups, some supported by Hungarian-American financier George Soros, which offer legal and other aid to asylum-seekers. The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, one of the groups most vilified by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-immigration government, said its activities were lawful and called the proposal ""unacceptable in a democratic state. "" The bill ""threatens to lock up and imprison those who behave legally in the defense of Hungary's human rights obligations,"" the group said. The constitutional amendments put forward add language saying that ""foreign populations cannot be settled in Hungary"" and would place additional limits on eligibility for asylum. For example, people who entered Hungary from a country where they were not persecuted or threatened with persecution would be ineligible. Since most asylum-seekers from the Middle East and Asia reach Hungary from Serbia, they would be unlikely to meet the new requirement."

The deadlock is deflating hopes that lawmakers will reach a breakthrough before another shutdown deadline next week. At risk are up to $80 billion in increases for the Pentagon this year alone, and nearly as much money for domestic programs. Almost $100 billion worth of overdue assistance for hurricane-slammed Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida is being held up. The knot involves about $1. 2 billion in agency operating budgets for the fiscal year that began in October, along with hurricane relief, President Donald Trump's $18 billion-plus border wall, and other odds and ends. The measure has been hung up for months as lawmakers in both parties struggle first with a deal to increase tight limits on spending that are left over from a failed 2011 budget agreement. It takes both Republicans and Democrats to lift the limits, called spending ""caps"" in Capitol-speak. But talks have proceeded slowly and are now awaiting agreement on legislation to address younger immigrants currently protected from deportation under the soon-to-expire Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA."

Writing that the decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program was “virtually unexplained”, the US district judge John Bates said on Tuesday he would stay the order for 90 days to allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) an opportunity to “better explain” its decision. “DACA’s rescission was arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed adequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful,” Bates wrote in his 60-page ruling, released on Tuesday evening.

411	5	Opinion: EU refugee deal with Turkey full of hypocrisy: The deal between the European Union and Turkey exposes the mendacity of European policy with regard to the so-called refugee crisis. The deal is being presented as a success. The reality is anything but. The agreement stipulates that for every Syrian who legally enters Turkey and continues on to the EU, another refugee who has illegally entered the EU will be sent back to Turkey — so far, so good. In reality, numbers collected by the European Commission show the deal is not working at all. Since going into effect, some 12,500 immigrants have entered the EU from Turkey, yet only about 2,100 illegal immigrants have been sent back to Turkey during that same period. Clearly stated: Rather than the agreed upon 1-to-1 rule, the EU has taken in six times as many people as it has sent back to Turkey. The blame lies, however, not in Ankara but in Brussels. The EU is simply unable to process the sheer number of cases piling up in camps on the Greek isles in the Aegean Sea. The borders are not sealed But Turkey has failed to uphold its end of the deal as well.

International efforts have been increasingly aimed at stemming the migrant flow across the Mediterranean. The rescue vessel was sequestered by Italy on Sunday in the Sicilian port of Pozzallo, a day after it docked and the rescued migrants came ashore. Italian authorities say they are investigating the rescue group for suspected criminal association and aiding illegal immigration. Proactiva said the investigation stems from the group's refusal Thursday to hand over to Libya's coast guard 218 migrants it had just saved in international waters 70 nautical miles from the Libyan coast."

ATHENS, Greece — They dreamed of better lives in the West — and their journeys ended in an unlikely spot: a makeshift tent city built on a baseball field where Olympians once roamed. When the asylum-seekers and refugees came to Greece in their thousands in 2015, the Athens Summer Games were a distant memory. Some 11 years after the country hosted the games at an estimated cost of $11 billion, many of the venues had been abandoned. Many still remain derelict. But as Greece struggled to cope with the numbers of people arriving on its shores and crossing its border with Turkey, it built a camp for migrants inside the former Olympic baseball stadium. The asylum-seekers lived on the field where Yuli Gurriel, now with the Houston Astros, and Nick Markakis, who later won two Gold Gloves and is now an outfielder with the Atlanta Braves, competed for Olympic medals in 2004. Before being shut down last year, the camp was home to as many as 5,000 people.

If it’s affirmed by the US Supreme Court in an upcoming case, it could also have far-reaching consequences for many more. The high court on April 25 will hear oral arguments on the case, formally known as Donald J. Trump, President of the United States v. State of Hawaii. At issue specifically is the third iteration of the travel ban, ordered by the president last September after lower courts barred implementation of prior versions. The latest presidential proclamation restricts travel to the US for citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries: Libya, Iran, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea, and Venezuela. (Chad was removed from the list this month. ) Hawaii’s district court issued a preliminary injunction in October (paywall) barring the ban’s enforcement, finding that the order violates the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Hawaii court’s ruling in December, but the Supreme Court, at the president’s request, allowed the ban to take effect while legal challenges continued. The high court in January agreed to review the case. There are now two major issues before the court.

316	9	Undocumented immigrant detained by bondsmen on livestream​​​​​​​: KGTV - A video appearing to show the arrest of an undocumented immigrant is making rounds on the internet. The incident was livestreamed on Facebook by Ryan McAdams, who says he was out with Watkins Bail Bonds on Sunday when they were called to collect a client they had bonded out for a DUI charge. “A relative of the individual in the video called the bond office that the individual didn’t have his papers in order and he was looking to abscond,” said McAdams “and go back south over the border.” McAdams adds that what he recorded and posted to Facebook is a legit operation. However, some like Chicano activist Alexis Del Castillo says the video is tasteless and shows the exploitation of an immigrant. “He didn’t just bully him he like tormented him in front of everyone,” said Del Castillo, “I think it takes someone really despicable to do that sort of thing.” McAdams says he knows some people see it a certain way, but he just wants people to understand the reality others have to deal with. “He was in there for a DUI arrest and he was going to flee on that leaving a company $5,000 dollars behind,” said McAdams, “Everyone is held up to the same laws.”
149	9	Man charged with marrying 6 women to evade immigration laws: WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) — A Massachusetts man has been charged with accepting money to marry six women to help them evade immigration laws. Federal prosecutors allege 57-year-old Peter Hicks, of Worcester, married the women from sub-Saharan African nations who were in the U.S. illegally between 2003 and 2013 and filed for immigration benefits for four of them. Authorities also allege that on at least one occasion, he was still married to one woman at the time of his marriage to another. He is also alleged to have recruited others to enter into fraudulent marriages. Hicks was released following an initial appearance in federal court in Worcester on Tuesday. He faces a maximum of five years in prison if convicted. His federal public defender did not return a call for comment.
269	5	UN says people disappearing in northern Mexico border city: MEXICO CITY (AP) — Jessica Molina has not seen or heard from her husband since March, when Mexican marines broke through their door in Nuevo Laredo and took Trejo and a friend away. Molina, a U. S. citizen, said Wednesday that her 41-year-old Mexican husband, Jose Daniel Trejo Garcia, is a mechanic with an established business in Laredo, Texas, where they live. They were only in Nuevo Laredo because she had recently had surgery in Monterrey and was returning to have stitches removed. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Wednesday called on the Mexican government to “take urgent measures to stop the wave of forced disappearances in Nuevo Laredo and surrounding areas” and said “there are strong indications” that they were committed “by a federal security force. ” The U. N. office documented the disappearance of 23 people since the start of February in Nuevo Laredo and said there could be many more. While it did not name those missing, Trejo Garcia is among those counted by the non-governmental Nuevo Laredo Human Rights Committee. “We have documented 56 forced disappearances from Jan. 20 to May 21,” said Raymundo Ramos, president of that group.
122	8	Calais War Zone as 100+ Afghan, African Migrants Do Battle: At least five people suffered gunshot wounds and dozens were injured as violent clashes between Afghan and Eritrean migrants broke out in and around the French port city of Calais. The violence broke out around 3pm on Thursday afternoon when a brawl began between rival gangs of migrants from Afghanistan and Eritrea “armed with sticks and stones” near Calais Hospital. The fight, which lasted almost two hours, reportedly began with an Afghan migrant opening fire, AFP reported. Four Eritreans, aged between 16 and 18, received bullet wounds and are “in critical condition,” the local prefecture said. A fifth is also in “very serious condition” and was transported to the hospital in Lille, the authorities added, without disclosing the age and nationality of the injured. Three others suffered “multiple injuries. ” Shortly afterwards, over a hundred Eritreans “armed with sticks” charged at 20 Afghan migrants five kilometers (three miles) away from the first site, in the town of Marck, forcing police to intervene “to protect the Afghan migrants,” the local prefecture said, putting the number of Eritreans at 150 to 200. Another incident happened in the industrial area near the infamous ‘Jungle’ migrant camp, which was shut down in October 2016.
137	6	"Syrian child refugees taught to release stress and resist recruitment: By Sally Hayden BEIRUT (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The screams of a dozen Syrian and Palestinian children pierce the air of a community center in Lebanon's Shatila refugee camp. Yet the children are not hurt. They are yelling to express the anger and fear they feel as victims of conflict in special ""peace education"" classes. ""We don't hit each other. We don't say bad things about each other. Boys don't hit girls,"" said 11-year-old Hala, who asked not to be identified for security reasons. Hala fled Deir el Zor in Syria and has been living in Lebanon for less than two years. She said one of her favorite activities is ""playback"", where each child will tell a story or describe a situation that is bothering them and will have the other children act it out. Organized by Basmeh and Zeitooneh, a local charity, the classes in a chaotic fifth floor room were set up to help children voice their opinions, release the stress caused by war and displacement and rediscover their imaginations, staff say. They hope by providing children with activities such as painting, dram and storytelling, they will be less vulnerable to recruitment by militant groups preying on children and teenagers who may be out of school with little to occupy them."

It Doesn’t Always Say Why: In handwritten cursive, a Russian immigrant named Marina wrote out the story of the day U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents took away her 1-year-old baby while she was being held in a detention facility in southern California. “I cried and begged, kneeling, not to do this, that this was a mistake, not justice and not right,” she wrote. “She was so little that no one knew anything about her. I was very afraid for her and still am!”
443	2	America Is Better Than Trump's Cruel Immigration Policies: The Trump administration’s new immigration policy of forcibly separating children from their parents when they show up at the border without documents is not only inhumane and un-American, but it also betrays President Trump’s complete ignorance of current immigration laws, the immigration issue and the naked political motive behind such a draconian and unprecedented move. Attorney General Jeff Sessions told the country the administration would start systematically separating children from their parents at the border, no matter if they came seeking asylum from certain death in their home countries. Sessions, however, erroneously couches the new policy in terms of it being a deterrent for those who seek to smuggle their children over the border. He said, “If you don’t like that then don’t smuggle children over our border. ” What Sessions is not telling the American people is that he is now arresting and separating every child and parent that appears at the border, even those who come legally by turning themselves in to the authorities, seeking asylum. These families are not “smuggling” their children over the border. They are availing themselves of an incredibly humanitarian American value — being able to seek protection from violence and persecution in another country.
58	8	"Judge who freed detained immigrant raises targeting issue: NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge who ordered a detained immigration rights activist facing deportation to be immediately released raised ""grave concern"" over the argument that he had been targeted because of his political activities, a concern also expressed by immigrants and their advocates over his and others' cases. During a hearing in Manhattan federal court on Monday over the detention of Ravi Ragbir, U.S. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest asked a prosecutor what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had gotten out of detaining the activist. Ragbir has been fighting deportation for years following a wire fraud conviction and is executive director of the New Sanctuary Coalition of New York City, a coalition of 150 faith-based groups. Ragbir was taken into custody on Jan. 11 when he checked in with immigration authorities and was told that he was being detained. In her ruling, Forrest called his treatment ""unnecessarily cruel"" and ordered that he be immediately let out of detention. She also refused a government request to halt her order for a possible appeal. ""It ought not to be — and it has never before been — that those who have lived without incident in this country for years are subjected to treatment we associate with regimes we revile as unjust, regimes where those who have long lived in a country may be taken without notice from streets, home, and work."
195	6	Dept. of Homeland Security dismisses ‘fearmongering’ about immigration raids: WASHINGTON — Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been conducting what Department of Homeland Security officials describe as a “targeted enforcement surge” and arresting undocumented immigrants for the past week. While the arrests have generated rumors and fears that the agency is stepping up raids after the inauguration of President Trump, DHS officials insist that the activity is routine and that it is largely aimed at undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions. “ICE is not performing indiscriminate raids or sweeps or checkpoints when we go out. We know the people we want to apprehend,” DHS Press Secretary Gillian Christensen told Yahoo News on Monday evening. “We’re not just going to random doors or pulling random cars over.”Christensen further described reports of identification checkpoints and random home visits as “needless fearmongering and completely inaccurate rumors.” She said the agency is eager to “take the level of fear in the community down, while still doing our job.” Christensen also stressed that ICE is working off “target lists” and that “75 percent” of the people who have been arrested have criminal convictions.
271	4	Trump has proved the experts wrong on immigration politics: Just days before last Tuesday’s Texas primary, George P. Bush, candidate for reelection as Texas Land Commissioner, was out on the campaign trail touting his endorsement from President Donald Trump. If you predicted this before 2016, you really should hang out a shingle and start charging for psychic readings. A lot of people will be lining up to get your stock picks and NCAA Tournament brackets. George P. Bush is the son of former Florida governor and recent presidential candidate Jeb Bush. He’s the nephew and grandson of two former presidents, one of whom was also governor of Texas. Despite this glittering political lineage, or possibly because of it, the 41-year-old was in a primary fight for his political life. This should tell us something about immigration politics in America. After Mitt Romney lost the presidential election in 2012, the Republican party commissioned an analysis popularly known as “the autopsy. ” Its most notable recommendation for the GOP’s future success was this: “we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. ” That’s usually understood to mean some combination of border security and limited-to-full amnesty for people who have entered the country illegally.
461	5	Court overturns ruling: Allowed immigrant to stay in Kan. after conviction: BARTON COUNTY -The Kansas Court of Appeals reversed a district court judge’s decision to set aside the identity theft conviction of a woman who moved to Kansas from Mexico in 2003 without proper documentation to join her husband, according to court documents. Following a jury trial, Melissa Valles was convicted of illegally using the social security number of a Colorado resident to obtain employment at several Great Bend businesses, according to a media release from the court. However, the judge who heard the case granted a motion to arrest judgement, essentially ruling that the court did not have jurisdiction over the case. The Barton County Attorney’s Office appealed that decision, and the Court of Appeals agreed that the trial judge was incorrect in his decision. Arguing the State’s case to the three-judge panel on the Court of Appeals, then-County Attorney Doug Matthews contended that a change in the law allowed the case to continue even though the language used in the complaint to charge Valles was technically incorrect. The judges on the Court agreed, holding that the complaint was sufficient since it alleged facts that, if proven beyond a reasonable doubt, would show that Valles had committed a crime in Kansas.
64	5	"Evangelicals may be driving GOP to embrace DREAMers: WASHINGTON — As the debate over immigration rages in Congress without an agreement in sight, there is growing consensus over one piece of the equation: The need to protect undocumented immigrants who came to the U. S. as children from deportation. Republicans have come to embrace these so-called ""DREAMers"" in part because many evangelical Christians — who make up a quarter of Americans and are an influential conservative bloc within the GOP — have become more vocal about the topic over the last half decade. The idea stems from the Bible: “Individuals are created within the image of God and have value and worth. So each person — regardless of their location and their birth and skin color, it doesn’t matter. That individual has value and worth in the eyes of God and they should be valued by other individuals as well,” Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, an evangelical Christian and former youth camp director, told USA TODAY. Former President Barack Obama issued an executive order that gave protections to nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the U. S. as children. Republicans said the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was unconstitutional because Congress is supposed to handle immigration — not the president."

Ernakulam Principal Sessions Court judge N Anil Kumar, who passed the order, will now pronounce the quantum of punishment for the convict tomorrow. Muhammed Ameerul Islam – the migrant labourer from Asam - was found guilty under various sections of the IPC including 302 (murder), 376 (Rape) 376 (A) (causing death or causes the woman to be in a persistent vegetative state while committing rape).

He was booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules. As many as 100 witnesses were examined during the trial which commenced in April last.
404	4	European migrant rescue NGOs stuck on dry land amid ‘political crackdown’: European NGOs claim they are being prevented from rescuing migrants at sea amid a “political crackdown” that has left their vessels stuck on dry land. German charity Sea Watch told Euronews that its search and rescue plane had been denied permission to continue operating from Malta, while its ship Sea Watch 3 was being banned from leaving a Maltese port. In an email to Sea Watch seen by Euronews, DC Aviation Dispatch — the interface between the NGO and Maltese Authorities — quoted officials as saying that no permit would be issued for any search and rescue operation “unless this is being done on behalf of Malta or on request by a neighbouring country”. Sea Watch 3 requested to leave a port after undergoing maintenance earlier this week but the port authority refused, saying that the vessel’s status was under review. Sea Watch spokesperson Ruben Neugebauer told Euronews the NGO believed the decisions were part of a “political crackdown” on civil sea rescue, and compared it to stopping an ambulance trying to reach a road traffic accident. “We [have been] conducting search and rescue operations from Maltese ports and airports for more than two years.

Abe told a parliamentary session that the government is formulating measures including protecting foreigners, landing procedures, building and operating shelters, and screening asylum seekers. (Yoshinobu Shimizu/Kyodo News via AP) TOKYO (AP) — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday that Japan's government is drawing up contingency plans in case a crisis on the Korean Peninsula sends an influx of refugees to Japan. Abe told a parliamentary session that the government is formulating measures including protecting foreigners, landing procedures, building and operating shelters, and screening asylum seekers. Abe's disclosure came in response to a question that had been occasionally asked in the past but is now more realistic than ever with North Korea's missile capability rapidly advancing and tension with the U. S. rising. The government has been also working on evacuation plans for about 60,000 Japanese from South Korea in case of a crisis.
372	7	Former border agent convicted of federal gun charges: SAN DIEGO — A former U. S. Border Patrol agent was convicted by a federal jury Friday in San Diego of seven counts of illegal transportation of firearms and one count of possession of a short-barreled rifle. Martin Rene Duran, 48, of Chula Vista was found guilty following a three-day trial, according to Kelly Thornton, the director of media relations for the Office of the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of California. “According to evidence presented at trial, Duran purchased seven firearms in Arizona in 2011, 2013 and 2014,” Thornton said. “Duran made these purchases using an Arizona driver’s license with an address where he never lived and claimed Arizona residency even though he resided in California. “At the time of the execution of a federal search warrant in October 2015, Duran was in possession of multiple firearms that were illegal in California and one short-barreled rifle. ” Duran is due to be sentenced on April 30.

The state's $125 billion budget — which is set to be approved Thursday — has a related measure to prevent local governments from signing contracts with federal authorities for immigration detention facilities or expanding existing contracts. It would also have the state attorney general review conditions at immigration detention facilities in California. ""I think we send a very clear message in this budget that California is going in the opposite direction of Trump's administration,"" said Sen. Ricardo Lara, a Democrat. The budget was negotiated by Gov. Jerry Brown and Democratic legislative leaders. A message was left for the state Senate's Republican caucus. Immigration and Customs Enforcement declined to comment on pending legislation. The proposal is the latest in a series of moves by California lawmakers aimed at protecting immigrants in the country illegally from President Donald Trump's efforts to ramp up immigration enforcement. State lawmakers are also weighing proposals to provide lawyers for immigrants in deportation proceedings and limit communication between local police and federal immigration agents."

Erdogan, speaking at a news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin after a meeting in the Black Sea city of Sochi, said he believed Putin would play a major role in establishing a ceasefire in Syria. Erdogan said Turkey considered the Syrian Kurdish YPG, which the United States supports as an ally against Islamic State militants, as no different from the radical Sunni group. ""We do not differentiate between terrorist organizations. Daesh, YPG, Al Qaeda are all the same for us,"" Erdogan said, in comments broadcast live on television. Daesh is an Arabic name for the Islamic State militant group. ""It is our mutual responsibility to scrape away their roots,"" he said. Erdogan has repeatedly criticized the United States for its support of the YPG in the fight against Islamic State. Turkey sees the group as a extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has carried out a three-decade insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast. Turkish warplanes carried out air strikes against Kurdish militants in northeastern Syria and Iraq's Sinjar region last month in an unprecedented bombardment of groups affiliated with the militant PKK."

Merkel's conservative Union bloc and the center-left Social Democrats hope to conclude coalition talks Sunday. The Social Democrats are seeking more palatable compromises on some issues already discussed in preliminary talks. Those include whether close relatives can join migrants with a status below full asylum. They can't now, but that rule expires in mid-March. News agency dpa reported the two sides agreed Tuesday that, from August, a maximum 1,000 relatives monthly should be let in, plus people who can be admitted under existing rules for hardship cases. That's largely in line with a preliminary agreement that was considered a success for conservatives. But Social Democrat lawmaker Eva Hoegl said her party had ensured that relatives can come.

Husband, father and grandfather Domingo Ferreira was deported back to his country in February. Eyewitness News was there in January when Ferreira was set to be deported, but he was granted some extra time. Now the family is trying to adjust to a life without him. “It was really a reminder at that moment, that wow. He is gone. This is life,” said Domingo’s wife Diane Ferreira. Since he left in February, Domingo’s grandson Lucas was born. Domingo hasn’t met him in person yet, he’s only seen him on FaceTime. “Taking the family picture without him was so difficult. I felt so guilty sending it to him because I knew he was missing,” Diane Ferreira said. The only way the family can see each other is by iPad or cell phone. Eyewitness News spoke with Domingo on Wednesday. “I mean, it's never going to be the same, unless I get to live with my family again but it's been really tough,” he said. He had been in the United States legally for 30 years, but stole a purse 12 years ago and did prison time.

In an attempt to stem the flow of people across the Mediterranean to Europe, the EU is financing a system that routinely acts in collusion with militia groups and people traffickers to “make money from human suffering”, a report from the human rights group claims. EU's policy of helping Libya intercept migrants is 'inhuman', says UN Read more Following the provision of ships, training and funding from the EU and Italy to the Libyan coastguard, the number of arrivals to Italy fell by 67% between July and November compared with the same period in 2016. Deaths at sea have been reduced commensurately. Yet Amnesty claims the coastguard and those to whom they hand over refugees, migrants and asylum seekers, are often acting in cahoots with criminal gangs and militia. Agreements between the coastguard and smugglers are signalled by markings on boats that allow specific vessels to pass through Libyan waters without interception, it is claimed.

The Tokyo District Court upheld a government ruling made five years ago, that the pair's bid for asylum was not admissible under international refugee law. ""The world understands the Syrian situation - it's getting worse. But the Japanese court hasn't understood that at all,"" one of the plaintiffs, Joude Youssef, told a news conference.

S. that have begun arriving at the U.

It is a disgrace. We are the only Country in the World so naive! WALL,” Trump tweeted. He also repeated his position that negotiations between the U.

S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement. Our Country cannot accept what is happening! Also, we must get Wall funding fast,” the president wrote.

Since his inauguration on January 20, the president has signed an executive order to bar entry of immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. That followed an executive order signed on January 25 to begin the construction of a concrete wall along the US southern border with Mexico. While many of the president's supporters view his actions as a fulfillment of his campaign promises, some are concerned about the economic ramifications of a decline in immigration and a spike in deportation. In light of these developments, WalletHub, the personal finance website, has released a report that shows certain states benefit from ""foreign born populations"" more than others. ""We determined which states benefit the most - and the least - from immigration using 18 key indicators, ranging from median household income of foreign-born population"" to ""jobs generated by immigrant-owned businesses as a share of total jobs,"" they said."
309	5	Bridging The Gap With World Refugee Day: Since 2015, the word “refugee” has carried more and more weight in society because of the Syrian refugee crisis. With this word comes a multitude of political opinions, and oftentimes, arguments ensue. Whatever your opinion on refugees and immigrants, the majority of people can agree that safety, shelter, food, and hope are necessities of life. World Refugee Day, to be celebrated June 20th, honors the people that have courageously searched for those exact same things beyond the pestilence, persecution, and violence of their various homelands. One of the main sponsors of this event is Bridge Refugee Services, a nonprofit that facilitates refugee settlement in Chattanooga. Bridge Refugee Services has played an extremely integral part in settling refugees in affordable housing, assisting in language acquisition, and providing self-sufficiency through job opportunities. World Refugee Day will be celebrated at the Camp House by engaging in some refugees’ personal stories and journeys, live music, food from a variety of cultures prepared by past and present Bridge clients, and even an art station for any children who attend. This gathering will not only be a celebration of the refugees’ past journeys but also a celebration of the beacon of hope that Chattanooga can become for asylum seekers in the future.
468	6	Trump to sign executive order Tuesday targeting H1-B visas: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order that seeks to make changes to the H1-B visa program that brings in high-skilled workers. Trump is heading Tuesday to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he plans to sign an order dubbed “Buy American, Hire American,” said administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity despite the president’s frequent criticism of the use of anonymous sources. The officials said the order, which Trump will sign at the headquarters of tool manufacturer Snap-on, would direct the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Labor and State to propose new rules to prevent immigration fraud and abuse. Those departments would also be asked to offer changes so that H-1B visas are awarded to the “most-skilled or highest-paid applicants. ” The White House said the program is currently undercutting American workers by bringing in cheaper labor and said some tech companies are using it to hire large numbers of workers and drive down wages. Administration officials said the order also seeks to strengthen requirements that American-made products be used in certain federal construction projects, as well as in various federal transportation grant-funded projects. The officials said the commerce secretary will review how to close loopholes in enforcing the existing rules and provide recommendations to the president.

"" Germany saw a huge influx of asylum-seekers and other migrants in late 2015 and early 2016. That tailed off about a year ago, and the number of crimes targeting asylum homes declined over the course of the year."
14	8	"Pollster testifies most Kansas voters can prove citizenship: KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) — A pollster hired by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach testified Monday that a survey of 500 adults he conducted found just one person who couldn't produce a document proving U. S. citizenship. The Topeka Capital-Journal reported his testimony came on the seventh day of a federal bench trial challenging Kansas' proof-of-citizenship requirement. Pollster Pat McFerron also acknowledged possible bias in his survey under questioning by an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. U. S. District judge Julie Robinson allowed McFerron to testify, even though he was not identified as an expert witness before the deadline that had been set by the judge. McFerron is president of Cole Hargrave Snodgrass, a firm that primarily caters to Republican candidates. He was paid $9,000 for his survey. One of the survey questions asked: ""In 2011, because of evidence that aliens were registering and voting in Kansas elections, the Kansas Legislature passed a law requiring that people who register to vote for the first time must prove that they are United States citizens before they can become registered. Do you support or oppose this? "" Seventy-seven percent supported the law, 14 percent opposed and 9 percent had no opinion."
382	3	"Third of Syrian refugee kids not in school, despite pledges: MANSHIYEH, Jordan — Since his family fled civil war in Syria five years ago, 15-year-old Ali al-Sbehi hasn't set foot in a school. Instead, he has put in 12-hour shifts in a supermarket, a fast food stand and now a coffee shop, enduring abuse from employers, back-breaking work and low pay because he is the sole breadwinner for his family of eight. ""I have no future,"" said the lanky teen with narrow shoulders, offering a sober assessment of his prospects. Ali is among more than half a million Syrian refugee children of school age — or one-third of the total — who are not in school or informal education in overburdened regional host countries Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt and Iraq. They should all have been enrolled by now under a pledge made 18 months ago by donor countries and international organizations at a Syria aid conference in London. At the time, donors promised hundreds of millions of dollars to meet the education target, as part of a shift from emergency aid to longer-term development to cope with the fallout from Syria's civil war, now in its seventh year. However, Syria aid has been plagued by persistent funding shortfalls, as donors face competing global crises."

The story of this group is happier than many others. The group of 92 migrants was rescued by the Niger Army in the north of the country, already seriously dehydrated and on the verge of death. The group, including women and children, was abandoned by traffickers without food or water. One of the group died after being taken to a treatment center. Two weeks ago a group of 40 migrants died of thirst after their truck broke down on the route to Libya then across the Mediterranean. In this case the migrants were abandoned near a well and so the majority survived. The traffickers pack them into trucks like cattle with little water and often in the middle of the desert, they ask for more money and if they do not pay, they are abandoned. Tens of thousands make the perilous journey each year across the Sahara. How many bodies lie under the sands?

178	8	Coalition's test likely to disadvantage those who need citizenship most: Citizenship applicants will need to demonstrate a higher level of English proficiency if the government’s proposed changes to the Australian citizenship test go ahead. Applicants will be required to reach the equivalent of Band 6 proficiency of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). To achieve Band 6, applicants must correctly answer 30 out of 40 questions in the reading paper, 23 out of 40 in the listening paper and the writing paper rewards language used “accurately and appropriately”. If a candidate’s writing has “frequent” inaccuracies in grammar and spelling, they cannot achieve Band 6. Peter Dutton offers 'bizarre' response to Labor's claim on citizenship briefing Read more Success in IELTS requires proficiency in both the English language and also understanding how to take – and pass – a test. The proposed changes will then make it harder for people with fragmented educational backgrounds to become citizens, such as many refugees. How do the tests now work? The current citizenship test consists of 20 multiple choice questions in English that ask about Australia’s political system, history and citizen responsibilities. While the test does not require demonstration of English proficiency per se, it acts as an indirect assessment of language.

(Source: AP Photo/Astrid Galvan) A holistic approach is needed to battle the opioid crisis that has gripped many parts of the country, fueled in part by the high volume of drugs that come across the southern border, Arizona officials said Wednesday. Members of the state's congressional delegation along with Gov. Doug Ducey and top law enforcement officials made the comments during a Homeland Security congressional subcommittee hearing in Phoenix. [CONTINUING COVERAGE: Opioid crisis in Arizona] Rep. Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican running for the U. S. Senate, hosted the hearing. She said 90 percent of the nation's illegal drugs come through ports of entry, often hidden in car compartments. McSally said it takes more than just law enforcement to battle drug abuse. But some Democrats at the hearing criticized Republicans for their past support of legislation that would curb Medicaid and programs to treat addiction.

(CBSNewYork/AP) — A federal judge has temporarily halted deportation proceedings against Indonesian Christians who are in the U. S. illegally but are seeking to gain legal status, including one man honored for his work helping to rebuild more than 200 homes after Superstorm Sandy. The order was issued Friday by U. S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and applies to Indonesians who have orders of removal dating to before 2009. The order affects roughly 50 people in New Jersey who had identified themselves to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2009 as part of a program to obtain work authorization and stays of deportation, according to the ACLU and Seth Kaper-Dale, co-pastor of a church where some of the immigrants sought sanctuary. The lawsuit came after several enforcement actions by immigration authorities in New Jersey that targeted Indonesian Christians and rekindled fears in a community that includes people who left Indonesia years ago to escape religious persecution.

All sides pressed toward an agreement by Monday night, though aides said it appeared more likely that the measure would be unveiled Tuesday for a House vote Thursday.

121	4	Syria’s ‘Aleppo boil’ spreads with refugees through the region: At first, Wesal Daher thought the bumps on her face were just blemishes. She would apply cream to her forehead and cheeks every day, but the bumps continued to grow, becoming large lesions. Daher didn’t know what to do. “At first they were small like this,” she says, pointing to some bumps that her 10-month-old son, Khaled, has on his leg. When she arrived in Lebanon last year, after escaping from their village near Raqqa in neighbouring Syria, a fellow refugee told her she had something called Aleppo boil and that she needed to go to a clinic. First reported in the northern Syrian city in 1745, Aleppo boil, also known as Aleppo ulcer or cutaneous leishmaniasis, is a parasitic disease that causes disfiguring skin lesions, often on the face and hands. It is not spread by skin-to-skin contact, but rather by sandflies, one-third the size of a mosquito, that bite a lesion on an infected person and become a host for the leishmania parasite. When the infected fly bites another person, the parasite is transmitted. The disease is not unique to Syria, but since the start of the country’s civil war in 2011 it has re-emerged there as a significant threat to public health.
217	4	Opposition wants action on illegal migrants: OTTAWA — An Opposition motion being debated in the House of Commons today calls on the government to act to stop the influx of illegal border crossers entering Canada from the U.S. Conservative immigration critic Michelle Rempel and public safety critic Pierre Paul-Hus say they believe the government is simply throwing money at the problem of irregular migration that has been ramping up again this year, notably in Quebec. Concerns were raised last week by the Quebec government over the mounting pressures caused by the tens of thousands of asylum seekers pouring into that province over the last year. Some officials are projecting a further 400 people a day could cross into Quebec through forest paths this summer to claim asylum in Canada — a situation Rempel says will only exacerbate ongoing backlogs in the processing of refugee claims.

The White House, according to reports, is pushing instead for extending protections for those immigrants until 2020 in exchange for border funding. Either deal would part of a must-pass spending bill to fund the government later this week.

I started it in Japan, celebrating the New Year’s Eve at a big concert hall with around 10. 000 other people together with my favorite musician Ayumi Hamasaki. Back then, I was on my New Year’s trip to Japan which lasted three weeks. I got two more weeks to travel around, meet friends and experience the country. This trip ended with a proposal and much bureaucratic stuff to do for preparing our wedding. Luckily we could handle everything without any bigger trouble and so we got married in July in Germany. A great day with wonderful memories. Finished with this point, next was the process to get my visa for moving to Japan. The plan was to leave Germany in October, so less than three months after our wedding. For a German native like me, now the normal process would be going to the Japanese Embassy in Berlin, giving them all the required documents and getting a spouse visa for Japan. Actually, that was also the way I wanted to do it. However, I phoned the Embassy about my issue, because I first wanted to know which documents they need and how long it will take to get the visa.

The Supreme Court agreed Monday to consider the issue. Immigration law says that if noncitizens commit a crime for which they can be deported, the government should take them into custody for potential removal when they're released from prison or jail. A person detained immediately can be held indefinitely. The government argues the same is true if the person is released and then later detained for possible removal. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that noncitizens not promptly detained must be given the opportunity to be released on bond.

The Immigration and Refugee Board is already trying to whittle down its current backlog, but received no new money in the latest federal budget. With 2017 application numbers expected to far exceed earlier projections, the board simply can't keep up, says the memo, obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act. The Immigration Department memorandum was drawn up this spring amid a flood of people illegally crossing into Canada from the U. S. to claim asylum, dominating headlines and raising pointed House of Commons questions about the integrity of Canada's borders and immigration system. The department was asked to explore estimated backlogs at the Immigration and Refugee Board and the associated wait times under different scenarios, following a meeting about the U. S. border-crosser issue in March. Since January, at least 2,700 people have been intercepted by the RCMP between legal border points; most went on to file claims. The memo does not directly address the impact of the border crossers, though certain sections were redacted.

215	6	New report calls for ways to retain more immigrants in Atlantic Canada: FREDERICTON – A new report says if Atlantic Canada wants to solve its economic and demographic problems, it must become more than a stopover for immigrants. The report entitled “The People Imperative” will be released Wednesday at a one-day summit on immigration and revitalization, being held in Fredericton. The report is prepared by the Public Policy Forum, an Ottawa-based think tank with ties to business and government. It says increasing immigration won’t work for Atlantic Canada unless people choose to stay. Right now the region has the lowest immigration retention rates in the country. Nova Scotia has a five-year immigrant retention rate between 2011-2015 of 72 per cent, while Newfoundland and Labrador is at 56 per cent, New Brunswick is at 52 per cent, and P. E. I. is at just 18 per cent. No province outside Atlantic Canada has a retention rate below 80 per cent. Atlantic Canada needs to boost immigration and retention if it is to combat the demographic challenge of an aging population. Frank McKenna, deputy chair of TD Bank group, former premier and Canadian ambassador to the United States, said it’s a challenge when you see population numbers dropping in parts of the region.

Statistics show a significant increase in the number of tourists to these destinations especially among young consumers. Accordingly, the Fliggy Online Visa system will bring these Belt and Road countries closer to Chinese consumers as tourist destinations.

The court could decide by next week whether to allow Trump's executive order to go into effect or follow the lead of lower courts that have stopped the order because they say it exceeds the president's authority and discriminates unconstitutionally. It's unlikely the high-stakes legal maneuvering will be mentioned Thursday, nor Trump's blasts at the federal judiciary in general and some of the justices specifically. Trump has called Chief Justice John Roberts ""an absolute disaster"" for conservatives. After Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in interviews last summer called Trump a ""faker"" and said she feared for the country if he were elected, Trump responded by saying that ""her mind is shot"" and that she should retire. Since then, Roberts administered the oath of office to Trump on Inauguration Day, and all of the justices attended a Rose Garden ceremony after the Senate confirmed Gorsuch's nomination."
419	7	Taiwan gives Chinese asylum seeker temporary housing: Taiwan’s immigration department says it has provided temporary accommodation to a Chinese dissident who left his tour group intending to apply for political asylum in democratic Taiwan. Zhang Xiangzhong abandoned his fellow travelers on April 13 hoping to stay on the self-governing island to promote democracy on the Chinese mainland. The department said Tuesday that it found Zhang on Monday night and provided him with temporary accommodation because he did not have any. It said it was investigating the reasons for him leaving his tour group. Taiwan stopped offering political asylum to Chinese citizens to discourage illegal immigrants and a string of plane hijackings in the 1990s by mainland citizens wanting to flee to Taiwan. The Taiwanese government says it sometimes offers long-term residence permits on a case-by-case basis.
176	6	"Chicago 'sanctuary church' shelters immigrants, endures hate speech: Chicago (CNN) Jessica has lived in the United States for almost 18 years. Her husband and their four children are American citizens. And she is terrified of being ripped away from her family and sent back to Mexico, a country that is no longer her home. ""I wake up at night and I can't sleep just thinking about it,"" the 50-year-old woman told CNN, holding back tears. (Jessica is not her real name; because of her fears of being deported, CNN is not revealing her identity. ) Jessica crossed the border in 1999 and made it all the way to Chicago, where she built a family and a new life. But she's never gotten her green card. And now, like many immigrants in the new, border-tightening era of President Donald Trump, she is facing an uncertain future. Mostly, she worries about her youngest children, ages 15 to 21. ""It's tough to think I'd be leaving them behind,"" she said, her voice breaking. ""If I get deported, what's going to be of them? "" Prayer is Jessica's only solace. That, and the church she attends in her largely Mexican-American neighborhood on Chicago's lower west side."
399	6	"Violence flares at Australian refugee facility in PNG: SYDNEY Violence has flared at an Australian asylum-seeker detention centre in Papua New Guinea (PNG), and shots were fired when local people tried to break into the centre after an argument got out of hand, media and a rights group reported on Saturday. There were no reports of serious injuries at the centre on Manus island but the trouble is likely to add to pressure on Australia from rights groups and the United Nations to close it and another centre in Nauru, criticised over poor conditions. Australia's ABC broadcaster said a large number of PNG men tried to break into the detention facility on Friday evening and police fired shots to disperse them. The men came back with guns and fired up to 100 rounds into the facility's accommodation wing, ABC reported. Australia's Department of Immigration and Border Protection confirmed in a statement that there had been trouble. ""There was an incident at the Manus RPC overnight involving residents and PNG military personnel,"" the department said, referring to the so-called regional processing centre. ""PNG military personnel discharged a weapon into the air during the incident. The incident was quickly resolved. "" One inmate was reportedly hit in the head by a rock thrown over the fence and was getting treatment, a department spokeswoman said."
426	6	"The Latest: Columbus statue protest over migrant deaths: The Latest: Columbus statue protest over migrant deaths BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The Latest on migration into Europe (all times local): 1:30 p. m. Activists in Barcelona have dressed a statue of 15th-century explorer Christopher Columbus in an orange life-vest to draw attention to the loss of migrant and refugee lives in the Mediterranean Sea. Two volunteer firefighters on Wednesday climbed the 60-meter (197-foot) monument towering above the northeastern Spanish city and placed the vest with the words ""Open Arms"" on the statue. A charity-run rescue vessel called Open Arms has arrived in Barcelona's port with 60 migrants who had been rejected by authorities in Italy and Malta. Non-governmental groups say they are being blocked and forced to take long journeys, leaving unattended a busy migrant transit route where deaths are mounting. Mar Sabe, a spokeswoman with the Proactiva Open Arms charity, said Wednesday's action was aimed at highlighting that ""violating the rights of migrants is violating everybody's rights. "" ___ 1 p. m. Aid groups say France's system for handling the unprecedented number of unaccompanied migrant children is arbitrary and hurts those who need help the most. In a report Wednesday, Human Rights Watch described a confusing system that is stacked against minors."
