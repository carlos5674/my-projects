Just like any doting grandmother Monira Alzin likes to show off pictures of her only grandchild. Unlike most families, she and her husband, Adnan Alnabolsi, are separated from the rest of their loved ones. The couple said they and their son, Waseem, fled bombings, gun violence and certain death in Syria. They fled to Egypt, where they waited for years until the family got the green light to come to the United States. ""He fled Syria and went to Egypt and stayed there for three years and three months,"" Alnabolsi told FOX40 through an interpreter. ""And then from there he came all the way down to the states. "" The couple said their son was supposed to join them a week later. ""He got the letter that he’s approved to come to the states,"" Alnabolsi said. ""He was so happy that he got that letter to be here. "" However, it's been more than a year and the Egyptian government hasn't given Waseem clearance."
33	5	2 arrested while seeking help after illegal border crossing: DERBY LINE, Vt. (AP) — A man and woman from Mexico who illegally entered Vermont from Canada were apprehended several miles away from the border while asking people for help to make a phone call, federal investigators say. Border Patrol agents were called Saturday morning after local shop owners reported the young couple was seeking help about 6 miles (10 kilometers) away from the border in the city of Newport, an affidavit filed in federal court in Vermont said. The couple later told agents they had entered the U. S. illegally from Canada the day before. The area in Derby Line is a common location for illegal border crossings. A separate document filed in court Friday said agents were called earlier that day to a spot near the elementary school in Derby Line after receiving a report someone might have entered the United States illegally from the Canadian community of Stanstead, Quebec. A man later identified as a U. S. citizen originally from Ecuador was spotted by agents driving a car with multiple people in it. The car was later stopped and only the driver was found in the vehicle. A short time later a third Mexican citizen was found hiding in the bushes.

The bill the government presented to parliament proposes amending nine existing laws related to asylum, the national border, and the police. It creates a new criminal offense in the Criminal Code of “enabling illegal immigration,” which is defined to include helping asylum seekers who are “not eligible for protection,” as well as to include border monitoring, producing and disseminating information, or “network building.” If committed “regularly,” or with the aim of “help[ing] several persons,” the offense would be considered aggravated. Anyone convicted would face a sentence of up to a year in prison. “This bill is the latest salvo in the Hungarian government’s war on refugees and those who help them,” said Benjamin Ward, deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Hungary’s government should withdraw this draft bill, honor the country’s duty to refugees, and end its odious campaign against rights defenders.”The draft law would curb the right to asylum by introducing new admissibility criteria that would bar most asylum seekers from getting protection in Hungary.

But for some vulnerable moderates breaking from some of the GOP's hardest-line proposals could be the key to avoiding defeat in November. Californian Steve Knight is one of nearly two dozen House Republicans who have signed on to a petition to force the House to vote on immigration proposals as early as next month. The plan is to allow the House to vote on at least four bills, including a pathway to citizenship that many conservatives hate. That plan frustrates House leaders who worry a messy fight on immigration will divide the party and boost Democrats' chances of winning control of the House in November. But Knight said Monday in an interview at a Memorial Day event in his home district that he is confident that it's better for him if they at least try to pass some immigration legislation. ""This is doing probably one of the hardest things in America that we've ever tried to do,"" Knight said."
375	6	Anti-migrant leader pushes to win national power in Italy: ROME — The leader of an Italian party that hopes to capitalize on growing resentment of migrants and asylum-seekers told supporters in Rome Sunday it would be “splendid” if he wins national elections and his government can issue one-way tickets home to undeserving refugees. Matteo Salvini wants to propel his anti-migrant Northern League, which was founded in 1991 as a regional party in Italy’s affluent north, to its first premiership in the national election set for early 2018. To do so, Salvini needs to build support in the south, an underdeveloped area of Italy the League has long denigrated as living off government aid. Many of the thousands of people who turned out for his Rome rally did come from southern Italy. One of them was Adriana Domeniconi, who travelled by bus from Matera in the “instep” of the boot-shaped Italian peninsula. “We’re no longer about north vs. south, but against those invading our country,” she said. Domeniconi was referring to the hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers and economic migrants that have received shelter in Italy after being rescued at sea from traffickers’ boats setting out from the Libyan coast. Opinion surveys have found that many Italians blame the newcomers for crime.

Mr Joyce, 50, revealed his New Zealand connection on Monday, and it sparked calls for him to stand down as it is illegal for dual citizens to have a seat in the Australian Parliament. By Tuesday afternoon, Mr Joyce told Parliament that the authorities in Wellington had said that he could renounce the New Zealand citizenship that he unknowingly acquired from his Dunedin-born father. He said: ""We received verbal communication from New Zealand before question time that has now been accepted, and we're looking forward to the written advice turning up pronto. "" The development does not mean the end of the bizarre affair, which threatens Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's one-seat majority in Parliament. But Mr Joyce will hope it bolsters the case to remain in his job - and preserving the government's wafer-thin buffer - until the High Court determines if he is eligible to sit as an elected official.

Ernakulam Principal Sessions Court judge N Anil Kumar is likely to pronounce the quantum of punishment on Wednesday. Muhammed Ameerul Islam was found guilty under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including 302 (murder), 376 (Rape) 376 (A) (causing death or causes the woman to be in persistent vegetative state while committing rape). The accused, however, was not found guilty under 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and various sections under SC/ST (prevention of atrocities) amendment Act 2015. The Court had on December 6 completed the hearing in the case and posted it for Tuesday for pronouncement of judgment. Islam, a migrant labourer from Assam and the lone accused in the case, was charged with brutally raping and murdering the woman, a law student, at nearby Perumbavoor on April 28, 2016. He was booked under various sections of the IPC and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules. As many as 100 witnesses were examined during the trial which commenced in April last.

Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri said Wednesday that authorities face a ""sad paradox,"" for as the international community increases its efforts to send more rescue ships close to Libya, more people die as smuggling rings pack ever more people onto tiny dinghies and push them out toward the open sea. He said the recorded number of migrant drowning deaths on the route in 2016, which might be much less than the true loss of life, stood at 4,579. Leggeri called it ""tragic and the reasons are well known: the number of migrants now (arriving) on very small dinghies."" The Frontex report ""Risk analysis for 2017"" said smugglers have grown more bold and reckless, knowing that rescue boats will be right on the edge of Libya's territorial waters. ""Dangerous crossings on unseaworthy and overloaded vessels were organized with the main purpose of being detected"" by military, EU or civilian vessels ready to pluck desperate migrants out of the water if necessary."

Wickremesinghe's comment comes as Australia increases pressure on failed asylum seekers on Papua New Guinea's Manus island and the tiny island nation of Nauru to return home voluntarily, including offering large sums of money, amid fears a deal for the United States to take refugees has collapsed.

304	7	Roxana Hernandez: Anger over transgender migrant's death in US: Immigrants’ rights groups have condemned the US government after a transgender immigrant died in US custody while seeking asylum. Roxana Hernandez, 33, was being held by immigration authorities in New Mexico when she fell ill. She had travelled in a migrant caravan disparaged by President Donald Trump. In a statement, US immigration authorities said all detained immigrants received comprehensive medical care. Friends say Ms Hernandez had fled violence, hate and stigma in Central America. “She saw in the United States the opportunity to start a new life free of abuse, risk and threats,” said a statement issued by a coalition of immigrants’ rights groups. After applying for asylum at the US border, Ms Hernandez was detained for deportation, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency said, citing previous convictions in Texas for theft, prostitution and illegally entering the country. According to ICE, Ms Hernandez was “processed as an expedited removal” when she applied for admission at the San Ysidro port of entry in California on 9 May. Six days later, on 15 May, she was transferred to the Cibola County Correctional Center in Milan, New Mexico.

Garaufis is hearing lawsuits seeking to overturn the administration's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The plaintiffs say the decision to end the program was motivated by racial animus against Latinos. Lawyers for the administration strongly deny the Republican president's decision was motivated by hatred. They say the DACA program was legally flawed. Trump has expressed sympathy for immigrants covered by the DACA program."

They are the EU's only land borders with Africa. The Spanish government said all the African migrants except two, which tried to climb the border wall, were sent back to Morocco. More than 1,000 illegal African migrants tried to enter Spanish territory by scaling a 6 meters wire border fence on New Year's Day. Fifty Moroccan and five Spanish officers were injured as they clashed with armed men carrying metal bars and rocks trying to break through the gates to access the border fences of Ceuta and Melilla. Both cities are Spanish enclaves, sitting on the northern shores of Morocco's Mediterranean coast. They are the European Union's only land borders with Africa. On 1 January, the Spanish government said all the African migrants except two, which tried to climb the border wall, were sent back to Morocco. The two migrants which were allowed to enter Ceuta needed hospital treatment. Local TV station Faro TV showed footage of the migrants reaching the wire fence in the early hours of Sunday before being hoisted down by cranes. Apparently more than 400 migrants attempted to access the fence at Ceuta last month and each year hundreds of sub-Saharan illegal African migrants try to enter Ceuta and Melilla from Morocco.

District Court Judge John Bates, the third federal judge and the first Republican appointee to rule against Trump administration attempts to kill DACA, wrote in a Tuesday opinion that the Department of Homeland Security has 90 days to provide him with a more compelling reason for rolling back the Obama-era program, otherwise he could order its restoration. “DACA’s rescission was arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed adequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful,” Bates wrote. ""Neither the meager legal reasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision is sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program,"" he continued. A Justice Department spokesman told Politico DOJ would continue to ""vigorously defend"" its position. ""DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend benefits to this same group of illegal aliens. As such, it was an unlawful circumvention of Congress,” spokesman Devin O'Malley wrote in a statement."

They are also asking the Minister for Justice and Garda management for more Armed Support Units (ASUs) to help police the estimated 208 crossings along the 500km Border. Gardaí along the Border say criminals and subversives see the force as weak and ill-equipped and they are correct, according to Garda Brendan O’Connor who represents Donegal-based members for the Garda Representative Association (GRA). “Our members feel that criminals and the cross-Border drug dealers and people of a political persuasion, they don’t take us seriously. They don’t see us as having the capabilities to take them on. They see us as weak. They see us as we see ourselves – untrained, ill-equipped and not enough numbers.” Israeli-made Uzi sub-machine guns were issued to local detective units until 2012 when Garda management said the gun no longer suited requirements. Detectives’ Smith and Wesson revolvers, which carried six rounds, were also replaced with the 15-shot SiG Sauer handgun. Management said the Sauer, with its increased capacity, would fill the role of both the Uzi and the revolver.
290	6	Asylum Seekers in Israel Say New Law Robs Them of Wages: The new law mandating that employers of asylum seekers and labor migrants put aside 20 percent of workers’ salaries until they leave Israel has left employers confused, and labor advocates are saying that these workers are being penalized by more than the legally mandated 20 percent as a result. The law took effect on May 1, and states that all employers of people who entered the country illegally must deposit 20 percent of the person’s salary – which generally is minimum wage - into a special fund, to be given to the person when he or she leaves Israel. The employer is supposed to contribute an additional 16 percent. The funds will be kept at Bank Mizrahi Tefahot, which won a tender. The law is designed to encourage people to leave the country on their own accord, as well as to make employers pay these workers benefits. But in practice, it turns out that many employers are not aware of the law, or don’t know how much money to set aside, or how to do it. While the law states that the deposit will be determined based on the salary as calculated for severance pay, Kav LaOved (Workers Hotline) received evidence from workers indicating that the withholding was based on the entire salary, including travel reimbursement.
414	4	Merkel Bows Down To Far-Right, Stops Migrants From Entering Germany: The far-right nationalist party, AfD, is rapidly gaining support in Bavaria and is presumably the reason that led Interior Minister Horst Seehofer to revolt against Merkel. The world is in the midst of the worst refugee crisis since World War II but millions of migrants and asylum seekers are facing even harsher crackdowns. The most recent case in point: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who once pushed for an open-border policy, has just agreed to a half-baked deal that will make it harder still for migrants to enter Germany. Merkel has faced a revolt from far-right parties over her comparatively welcoming stance towards migrants and refugees. To save her crumbling governing coalition and mollify her rebellious Bavarian allies, the German chancellor has agreed to close asylum “transit camps” along three Austrian borders. According to The Atlantic, migrants seeking asylum in Germany, who have already applied on other European Union countries would not be turned back at the border immediately. Instead, they will be camped at transit centers along the German-Austrian border. From there, Germany will send rejected asylum seekers back to their countries after they strike a negotiation with the countries. If a deal is not struck, rejected refugees will be sent back to Austria on the basis of an agreement with Vienna.

Rep.

Curiously, the board members that carried out the investigation into the rights abuses were all absent at the presentation of the report by officials of army headquarters in Abuja.

A similar assault on December 9 saw more than 400 migrants enter the tiny enclave. They tried “to force open some of the doors in the external fence, using iron bars, wire cutters and large stones with which they assaulted Moroccan forces and (Spanish) Guardia Civil (police) agents,” it added. Five Spanish policemen and 50 members of the Moroccan forces were injured, including one who lost an eye, it said. A Moroccan interior ministry statement said that of those members of the security forces who were hurt, 10 were in a serious condition.
324	5	Here's One Immigration Policy That Should Withstand President Donald Trump: Over the last 12 months, Americans have been bombarded with headlines and commentary about Donald Trump's plans to build a wall on the Mexican border, and deporting an estimated 14 million immigrants who have overstayed their visas. While Trump himself has never articulated his immigration policy beyond building a better border fence, hiring more border security officers, and deporting roughly a million criminal aliens, there is one immigration law on the books that should continue, beneficiaries of the law all say. Known as the investor visa, the EB-5 visa has been around since the 1970s. It became a tool for project finance during the 2008-09 financial crisis when business, primarily real estate developers, were unable to get commercial loans. At the same time, savvy developers knew that low interest rates in Europe and large allowances for Chinese investment abroad by Beijing was supportive of American real estate, both from individuals and institutional investors in need of long-term capital preservation. Developers had no way to raise capital, so they turned to rich foreigners from Beijing to Buenos Aires instead. Those foreigners are helping to build much of the new Miami and New York City skylines, and in some cases have also independently financed wifi projects on New York subways.

The government, which had been working on a plan to deport thousands of mostly Eritrean and Sudanese men to a third country against their will, said in a written response to the Supreme Court that it was no longer pursuing that option. Israel's immigration authority will continue to find options to deport migrants voluntarily, but their forced removal ""is no longer on the agenda,"" the government said."

Authorities say that on April 7, Defense Attache Colonel Joseph Emanuel Hall was driving an embassy vehicle when it collided with a motorcycle, killing 22-year-old Attique Baig and injuring another person on the bike. The deputy attorney general, Raja Khalid, informed the court on Tuesday that the federal government had placed Hall's name on Pakistan's ""black list,"" preventing him from leaving Pakistan. He went on to add that all airports around the country have been alerted. The dead man's family has petitioned the capital city's High Court, asking that Hall's name be placed on the so-called Exit Control List, or ECL, which bars people facing judicial proceedings from leaving Pakistan. Khalid told the court that placing the U. S. diplomat's name on the ECL required a long legal process. He argued during Tuesday's proceedings that Hall could neither be tried nor arrested because the Vienna Convention guarantees immunity to designated diplomats from criminal jurisdiction. The deputy attorney general emphasized the diplomat could only be tried if the U."

One Mother Speaks Out About Her Son’s Detention: Less than a week after deporting Venezuelans detained at Guantanamo Bay, the Trump administration has again flown about two dozen migrants to the U.S. naval base in Cuba. This time, however, the migrants are from countries across the world, including from places that are willing to take them back, which has raised additional questions about whom the government is choosing to send there and why. ProPublica and The Texas Tribune interviewed Angela Sequera, the mother of one of the first migrants sent to Guantanamo.

Based on the real case files of five asylum seekers from five countries and interviews with the medical and legal professionals who evaluate and represent them, The Waiting Game is an experimental news game that lets you walk in the shoes of an asylum seeker, from the moment they choose to come to the United States to the final decision in the cases before an immigration judge.

Border Patrol agent in Houlton faces a federal child pornography charge. Larry O’Neal, 44, was indicted on Feb. 15 for one felony count of possession of child pornography, according to documents filed in federal court. He is accused of having amassed a large collection of sexually explicit images of children, some of them violent in nature, on his personal computer, according to documents. He pleaded not guilty in U. S. District Court in Bangor on Feb. 22. CBP spokeswoman Stephanie Malin declined to comment on the case, but said the agency “is fully cooperating with the FBI and [Department of Homeland Security] Office of the Inspector General regarding this investigation. ” Homeland Security agents started investigating O’Neal in early January when they traced a downloaded file of suspected child pornography to an IP address at his house in Houlton, according to an arrest affidavit. The agency frequently investigates child pornography cases because the material often crosses international borders via the internet, as in O’Neal’s case, according to a criminal complaint.

In 2018, now 17 months after Donald J. Trump rode a dark tornado of racial animus to the highest office in the land, the first fact that we must acknowledge on the subject of immigration is that there is no relationship between the influx of immigrants and crime. Study after study has confirmed: Immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans. Moreover, the data, according to The Marshall Project, suggests that ""immigration has the effect of reducing average crime"" in communities, not to mention that net immigration from Mexico is below zero as more leave than enter. But Trump's campaign promises were never predicated on a careful deliberation of solid facts and hard truths. He laid his political ambitions on the racist lie that Barack Obama was not born in this country, and likewise his campaign and therefore his presidency were based on the racist lie that immigrants are predominately ""illegal immigrants, drug dealers, traffickers, gang members."" If Trump, as Adam Serwer asserts in The Atlantic, has only one scandal—the widespread and unprecedented corruption of the American government—his platform has one absolute: the raging demonization of non-whites as a threat to this country."

Supreme Court sidestepped a turbulent debate over illegal immigration on Monday, turning away an appeal by a group of asylum-seeking Central American women and their children who aimed to clarify the constitutional rights of people who the government has prioritized for deportation. The families, 28 women and 33 children ages 2 to 17 from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, had hoped the justices would overturn a lower court's ruling preventing them from having their expedited removal orders reviewed by a federal judge.

275	4	Fostering a teenage asylum seeker was challenging - and rewarding: Last year, my wife and I found ourselves without a foster placement, when a supervising social worker with our local council called to check in on us. We expressed surprise that we hadn’t been contacted recently about any placements and declared an interest in fostering unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, given that we had both worked in humanitarian contexts. She said the placement team would call us right back; a 15-year-old boy had arrived in a lorry the day before. They knew next to nothing about him except that he didn’t speak any English. There were no other carers in the county who could take him. The only other placement they could find would be hours away from his social worker. If we took him for a few weeks, they could at least do the initial meetings and get to know him, and he could do a local orientation programme. We didn’t expect to foster a teenage boy. As a same-sex couple in our early 30s, we’re on the younger side for foster carers and have few friends with teenagers. We’re happy taking pre-teen or younger children. In an earlier placement, we had looked after a 12-year-old asylum-seeking girl for a week’s respite.

(AP) — Seventy-seven people who entered the United States illegally were found packed inside a sweltering truck near the Mexico border, and the driver was charged with transporting people for financial gain, authorities said. Five children were among those found Monday evening in the cargo area of a brown truck painted to resemble a United Parcel Service vehicle, authorities said. The California Highway Patrol pulled the truck over because it had no tags and was weaving on Old Highway 80 in Boulevard, a tiny desert community in San Diego County about five miles from the border. A U.S. Border Patrol agent passing by on patrol stopped and asked the CHP officer if he would like assistance, the Union-Tribune said, citing a criminal complaint. When the agent approached, he saw the truck was riding low. The agent ""could smell body odor mixed with a distinct type of pungent soap which is commonly used in Mexico,"" according to the criminal complaint filed Tuesday. The records say the driver gave permission for the agent to open the truck. Inside, he saw people sweating and standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the hot cargo area, the complaint said, noting they were from Mexico and some acknowledged they had entered the U.S."

In a statement to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the state says: ""It is not possible to implement expulsions to a third country without (migrants') consent."" Some 35,000 African migrants, mostly from Sudan and Eritrea, are in Israel. The government wants most of them to leave, but has not been able to find a way to expel them lawfully.

295	6	Spain Ceuta: Migrants found hidden in car and suitcase: Police have detained two Moroccans who tried to smuggle migrants into Spain’s North African enclave of Ceuta – two hidden in a car and one in a suitcase. When police checked a car on Monday one person was found hidden in the dashboard and another in the hollowed-out back seat. The man and woman, thought to be Guineans, received first aid as they had had little air to breathe. Separately, a young African man was found hidden in a woman’s suitcase. That incident happened on 30 December and again the man – believed to be from Gabon – required urgent medical attention. A 22-year-old Moroccan woman had tried to smuggle him into Ceuta, but customs officers ordered her to open the case, which was tied to a trolley. The incidents coincided with a mass attempt by sub-Saharan Africans to storm the 6m (20ft) border fence separating Ceuta from Morocco. Fifty Moroccan and five Spanish border guards were injured when 1,100 migrants tried to get over the fence on Sunday. None managed to get through, but two people were injured scaling the fence and were taken to hospital in Ceuta. One guard lost an eye, officials said.

The first case was reported from Zirakpur police station which booked the owner of immigration firm Visa Max for allegedly duping a Haryana resident to the tune of Rs 8 lakh. The accused is yet to be arrested. The complainant in the case, Mahinder Singh, told Chandigarh Newsline that he had approached Visa Max Consultancy Services after one of his friends told him about the firm to send his son abroad. “The owner of the firm, Gursewak Singh, told me that my son can easily go to New Zealand.

The complainant, Sucha Singh, a resident of Gurdaspur district, told Chandigarh Newsline that his son Bikram Singh went to Canada on a study visa and they had deposited Rs 3.
259	6	Turkey denies report border guards shot at fleeing Syrians: ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish guards at the border with Syria are indiscriminately shooting at and summarily returning asylum seekers attempting to cross into Turkey, Human Rights Watch said. A senior Turkish government official denied the report on Saturday, repeating that Turkey had taken in 3. 5 million war refugees since the Syrian conflict began in 2011. New York-based Human Rights Watch said Syrians were now fleeing heightened violence in the northwestern province of Idlib to seek refuge near Turkey’s border, which remains closed to all but critical medical cases. Syrian armed forces have thrust deeper into the mainly rebel-held province in recent months and Turkey last month launched military action in the nearby Afrin region, targeting Kurdish YPG militia fighters. “Syrians fleeing to the Turkish border seeking safety and asylum are being forced back with bullets and abuse,” Lama Fakih, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said. President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin, asked about the HRW statement, told reporters that Turkish soldiers were there to protect these people and that Ankara has had an “open-door policy” since the start of Syria’s civil war in 2011. A senior government official later told Reuters: “There has been absolutely no case of civilians being fired upon at the border.

He was booked at a detention facility and will face state narcotics charges.

A mass migration followed, marred by violence and bloodshed, as about 15 million Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, fearing discrimination, swapped countries in an upheaval that cost more than a million lives. During the chaotic transition, train cars full of bodies arrived at railway stations in the twin cities of Lahore and Amritsar in the province of Punjab, which was split roughly down the middle at partition on Aug. 14, 1947. As India prepares to mark 70 years of independence on Aug. 15, families who witnessed the death and destruction during partition recalled the tales of horror. Brothers Santa and Niranjan Singh were lucky to survive the crossing from their village of Bhasin on the Pakistani side of the new border to their current home in Sarangra in India. Santa, then aged 15 or 16, says everyone was baying for blood. People were running around with knives, swords and guns. Up to a dozen people from their village were killed in the madness, Santa recalls, saying they carried an injured brother across the border after he was shot through the head.

S. are adapting to a harsh new reality: After enjoying decades of favoured status dating back to the Cold War, many of them now face the same deportation risks as any other immigrants. They feel betrayed by former President Barack Obama's administration, which in its waning days stripped away a nearly automatic path to citizenship that had been offered since the 1960s to Cubans who arrived on U. S. soil, even those who showed up without a visa. The change was part of a thaw in relations with Cuba, which also agreed to start accepting the return of more of its people who get deported. Now some Cubans have been detained at routine appointments with immigration officials, and many more fear they could be imperiled by old deportation orders or caught up in the increased arrests of non-citizens pursued by President Donald Trump's administration. ""I wasn't prepared for any of this. How could I have seen this coming?

The tents did not provide cover from the harsh winter wind or the freezing rain. Lesbos is a beautiful Greek island, but the camp is hell. I invite all European politicians to visit us, to witness our hardship and our hunger; to see what it feels like when your fate is in the hands of others. But you will also see that this situation can change: more humane migration policies can help us, they can give people here the protection and support they need and deserve. My story is similar to those of millions of other refugees from Syria and other countries. Conflict and persecution has torn our families apart, we had to leave our belongings behind, and our beautiful cities are no longer recognisable. We fled to survive and when we reached safety we were stopped and told to wait in inhumane conditions. That waiting has become living. I have been in Lesbos for seven months now, and there is only one thing I can be certain of: I will be stuck here for a long time.

315	10	Denver Fund Will Pay for Lawyers to Defend Immigrants Facing Removal: On Monday, March 19, Denver launched a long-anticipated legal defense fund for immigrants with $385,000 in its coffers. The aim of the fund is to provide legal representation to Denver residents who are fighting removal orders or who have requested relief through avenues like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, asylum applications, naturalization or certain visas. Mayor Michael Hancock formalized the fund through an executive order issued August 31, 2017, and originally appropriated $100,000 from the city budget. That fund was bumped up to $200,000 through a Denver City Council vote in November. More dollars have since been added through public and private sources including the Denver Foundation, the Rose Community Foundation and the Vera Institute of Justice. (The Vera Institute, which has helped with similar funds, including in New York, will provide Denver technical assistance and support. ) Using public dollars to provide legal representation to individuals in immigration cases is not unique to Denver. A handful of other cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, already have such programs. A Vera Institute study found that after New York City provided universal legal representation, ten times as many immigrants there won their cases, which included deportation proceedings.

The woman's death calls attention to the brutal treatment faced by immigrants held in ICE facilities, advocates say--cruelty that existed under the Obama administration and has worsened under President Donald Trump. Thirty-three year old Roxsana Hernandez had arrived in the U. S. on May 9 with the migrant caravan of hundreds of people who had traveled through Mexico from Central America earlier this spring. Hernandez was HIV-positive, and according to the group Pueblo Sin Frontera, which had organized the caravan, she died after having been held for several days in a cold cell known as an ""ice box"" at the San Ysidro port of entry.

145	3	Colombia opens border shelter for Venezuelans fleeing crisis: BOGOTA — Colombia's government has opened its first shelter for Venezuelans who are pouring across the border in ever-larger numbers to escape their nation's economic crisis. The bare-bones shelter opened Saturday near the border city of Cucuta will provide shelter of up to 48 hours for 120 people a day. Pregnant mothers, the elderly and minors who entered the country legally will be given priority. It will be administered by the Red Cross. Cucuta has been overwhelmed in recent weeks by an increasingly large exodus of Venezuelans. Many are sleeping on the streets and crime in the city has spiked as gangs recruit and take advantage of the desperate migrants. Some 35,000 Venezuelans cross into Colombia each day, many of them settling in with relatives or making short trips to buy food and medicine that has been scarce for years back home. But the numbers have surged in recent months, with an estimated 200,000 now looking to stay, as four-digit inflation plunges the oil-rich nation deeper into the abyss. Not all of them have been embraced amid growing hysteria that the economic refugees are stealing jobs and overwhelming already-stretched resources. Last week, authorities deported 130 Venezuelans who entered the country illegally and were sleeping outdoors on a basketball court in Cucuta.

The February 2 list of jihadis includes a senior leader in the Islamic counter-attack against personal freedom, Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook. He is an “alleged United States Hamas leader [who] received his green card through a predecessor program to the visa lottery,” said the statement. “Marzook was deported in 1997 for terrorist activities. ” The statement backs up Trump’s speech in the State of the Union speech, where he urged elimination of the visa lottery and chain migration programs, saying: It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work who will contribute to our society and who will love and respect our country. The jihadis include seven “mujahids” who arrived via the visa lottery and six “jihadis” who arrived via chain migration.

But the former Maltese prime minister and fellow Labour MEP Miriam Dalli stood out as a lone voice in the European Parliament as MEPs called for these citizenship programmes to be shut down. Sant described some of the reactions as “hysterical claims by some whiter than snow”, insisting it was unfair that countries like Malta and Cyprus are targeted, simply because they advertise their schemes. The Labour MEP said other countries had informal schemes but these were rarely criticised. Sant said Malta’s due diligence process was “extremely rigorous” but acknowledged that mistakes could be made. He urged fellow MEPs to identify cases of abuse and come forward with them rather than make blanket statements on money laundering. Sant argued for transparency in all golden visa schemes. But his strong defence for the cash-for-passport scheme stood in complete contrast with arguments made MEPs from across the political divide. One after the other, MEPs equated golden visa programmes with corruption and money laundering.

Binh Thai Luc, who had a violent criminal history and was supposed to be deported in 2006, was found guilty in the murders of a family of Chinese immigrants. He was also found guilty of five counts of attempted robbery and two counts of burglary.

Prosecutors said the family kept thousands of dollars in cash in the San Francisco home. Luc had more than $6,500 with him during his arrest. The jury was told that Luc settled his debt after the killings. “This was a very gruesome, brutal murder, and we’re pleased we’re getting some accountability for the family and for the community,” District Attorney George Gascón told The San Francisco Chronicle. Despite no eyewitness accounts of Luc’s involvement, investigators said one of the family member’s blood was found spattered on Luc’s jeans.

S. entry by people from six Muslim-majority countries. Trump is scheduled to visit the ornate, marble-clad courthouse in Washington for the investiture of new Justice Neil Gorsuch, whose Senate confirmation in April was his first major accomplishment. Attention will be focused on whether Trump, known for his off-the-cuff remarks and incendiary tweets, will follow the rules of an institution known for its courtesy and tradition. The stakes are heightened by the fact that Trump's so-called travel ban, one of his signature policies, is now before the justices after being blocked by lower courts. The president is expected to sit in the courtroom during the brief ceremony in which Chief Justice John Roberts will administer the judicial oath to Gorsuch. Trump is not expected to make a speech at the event, but he is likely to talk briefly to the justices beforehand in the court's conference room, as other presidents have done in the past, according to a court spokeswoman.

378	6	Trump And Sessions Send Warnings To Migrant Caravan Of 500 People Approaching U.S. Border: As a caravan of 500 migrants near the border, the U. S. sends warnings to the asylum-seekers. As a group of about 500 migrants from Central America quickly approach the U. S. border, President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have sent stern warnings to the caravan. Although it’s legal to seek asylum, it’s illegal to cross into the country without going through the asylum process. As reported by NBC News, Sessions pointed out that Mexico was going to allow the migrants to stay in their country, but that they declined the offer to continue their journey north. He then made a statement regarding the asylum process. “Let today’s message be clear: Our nation has the most generous immigration system in the world, but this is a deliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system. There is no right to demand entry without justification. Smugglers and traffickers and those who lie or commit fraud will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. ” Asylum is granted to people who have suffered persecution or have good reason to believe they will suffer persecution according to their race, religion, or nationality.
255	8	Hungary’s ‘Stop Soros’ bill seeks to criminalise migrant helpers: Individuals or NGOs that help illegal migrants gain status in Hungary could face prison sentences under a new set of government laws, informally known as the 'Stop Soros' plan. The legislation is part of the right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orbán government's campaign against George Soros- a Hungarian-born billionaire financier and philanthropist. Orbán's government has vilified Soros the past year as the main backer of illegal migration to Europe. “Those who provide financial means . . . or conduct this organisational activity on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison,” said the official text of the proposals. Meaning that anyone who gives a migrant a sandwich, blanket, or even a bottle of water could end up behind bars. “We need an action plan to defend Hungary and this is the Stop Soros package of Bills,” the interior ministry added in a comment. In contrast to earlier versions, the latest draft of the Bill, submitted to parliament on Tuesday, does not propose compulsory security checks for NGOs that work with migrants or a 25 percent tax on their foreign funding. The constitution would also be amended to stop other EU countries from transferring asylum seekers to Hungary, which rejects European Union quotas to distribute migrants around the bloc.

S. custody A transgender Honduran woman, who was part of the caravan of Central American migrants that arrived at the U. S. border earlier this month, died in detention on Friday. Roxana Hernandez, 33, died in the custody of U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at a hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico, from what appeared to be cardiac arrest. Hernandez was first admitted to a hospital more than a week ago “with symptoms of pneumonia, dehydration, and complications associated with HIV,” according to a statement from ICE. Immigration officials identified the woman as Jeffry Hernandez, but LGBTQ rights advocates and caravan organizers said her name was Roxana. An ICE spokesman confirmed Tuesday that Hernandez was part of the caravan. Hernandez surrendered at San Ysidro Port of Entry between San Diego and Tijuana and asked for asylum on May 9, according to Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the immigration-rights group that organized the caravan. The organization said she was held for five days by U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in a holding cell that is part of a facility many refer to as the “iceboxes” due to its temperature.

A government-chartered ship carrying the containers remained anchored at the island's main town Monday after municipal vehicles were used to block port facilities. The island's municipal board was due to meet later Monday to decide on whether to lift the blockade following talks with the government, state-run TV said.
87	7	17 Illegal Immigrants Found Locked In Semi At Edinburg, Texas Gas Station: A total of 17 illegal immigrants were found locked inside an extremely hot semi-trailer parked at a convenience store in Edinburg, Texas. The illegal aliens had been locked inside the truck for at least eight hours before law enforcement officials found them on Sunday. The 17 illegal immigrants hailed from multiple countries, according to comments Edinburg Assistant Police Chief Oscar Trevino made to local KGBT-TV reporters. The Texas law enforcement official said the illegal aliens hailed from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Romania. The Texas Flying J truck stop is located on Monte Cristo Road and is just a short distance across the Mexican border. Two suspects believed to have been in control of the 18-wheeler have been arrested. The male and female suspected human smugglers are reportedly of Cuban nationality. None of the illegal immigrants rescued from the tractor-trailer reportedly required medical attention. The Edinburg Police Department received an anonymous tip from an individual in Mexico claiming a loved one and several others were stuck inside a tractor-trailer at the Texas truck stop. Police officers knocked on all the semi-trailers parked at the Flying J until they found the one containing the illegal immigrants.
469	4	"White House Preps 'Wish List' of Hard-line Immigration Proposals: WASHINGTON — The White House is preparing to send a list of immigration proposals to Capitol Hill in the coming days, including backing for a bill that would make it easier for local police to question people they stop about their immigration status, according to four people familiar with the conversations. One source described the package as the ""wish list"" of Stephen Miller, senior policy adviser to President Trump and a known immigration hardliner. A senior administration official and three other sources familiar with the deliberations say the proposal includes part of the Davis-Oliver Act, which has been criticized by Democrats and some Republicans. The bill requires police to report to the Department of Homeland Security all identifying information on anyone they encounter who is suspected to be in the country illegally. It's a controversial piece of a plan intended to delineate the administration's immigration priorities as Congress considers how to handle the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, created by President Barack Obama to allow immigrants who were brought into the U. S. illegally as children to remain. U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during an early morning operation in Dallas."
31	5	New York City subway explosion arrest leads to discussion of immigration rules in US: NEW YORK (AP) — The arrest of a Bangladeshi immigrant accused of making a homemade pipe bomb and setting it off in the New York subway system has led to discussion of the nation’s immigration system, with President Donald Trump repeating his refrain that it needs to be overhauled in favor of more restrictions. What you should know: THE BOMBING SUSPECT Authorities have identified the bombing suspect as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah. Originally from Bangladesh, he arrived in the United States in 2011 and was living in Brooklyn. The Department of Homeland Security says he’s a lawful permanent resident of the U. S. HOW HE GOT HERE: Ullah came to the U. S. on an F43 visa, issued to him through his family connection to an American citizen. The American immigration system allows citizens to apply for certain relatives — spouses, children, parents, siblings and their spouses and minor children — to be allowed to come and live in the U. S. The visas fall under different preferences, or categories; siblings of U. S. citizens come in the fourth preference, the F4, and their children come under F43s. WHAT’S THE HISTORY? Since a law change in 1965 loosened what had been a very restrictive system, America’s immigration policy has been based around giving preference to people with advanced education or skills or those with family ties to U.

Melbourne: Australia on Tuesday abolished a visa programme used by over 95,000 temporary foreign workers, majority of them Indians, to tackle the growing unemployment in the country. The programme known as 457 visa allows business to employ foreign workers for a period up to four years in skilled jobs where there is a shortage of Australian workers. ""We are an immigration nation, but the fact remains: Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs, so we are abolishing the 457 visa, the visa that brings temporary foreign workers into our country,"" said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The majority of the visa holders were from India followed by the UK and China. ""We will no longer allow 457 visa to be passports to jobs that could and should go to Australians,"" he said. He said Australia will adopt a new 'Australians first' approach to skilled migration. As at September 30, there were 95,757 workers in Australia on primary 457 visa programme, ABC reported. The programme will be replaced by another visa programme, with new restrictions."
66	3	Nigerian asylum seeker arrested for murder in Switzerland: A 27-year-old Nigerian asylum seeker has been arrested by Swiss police in connection with the murder of a volunteer at the centre run by Catholic relief charity, Caritas. He was arrested on February 13, 2017. The Nigerian man is suspected to have stabbed the 22-year-old woman, identified as Soopita P, on a street in the western town of Ahaus on February 11. She had been stabbed in her upper body and throat, and died in a hospital as a result of her wounds. “Extensive investigations resulted in the suspicion of the asylum seeker from Nigeria,” Chief Prosecutor, Martin Botzenhardt, said. “Evidence so far suggests that the 27-year-old made several attempts to establish contact with the victim in recent weeks. ” German prosecutors said they will pursue an extradition request of the detainee after he was arrested on a European warrant. “Naturally this is a major turning point for our work,” said Hans-Peter Merzbach, who heads the Caritas mission in Ahaus. Merzbach noted that the mission would be offering psychological counseling to the victim’s colleagues due to the nature of the case. We must find out what kind of help the volunteers need,” he added.
204	6	Cuba tells U.S. suspension of visas is hurting families: HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba told senior U. S. officials during talks on migration in Havana on Monday that the U. S. decision to suspend visa processing at its embassy on the island was “seriously hampering” family relations and other people exchanges. A view of the U. S. and Cuban flags prior to the signing of agreements between the Port of Cleveland and the Cuban Maritime authorities in Havana, Cuba, October 6, 2017. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Relations between the former Cold War foes became strained after Donald Trump became the U. S. President, partially reversing the thaw seen during Barack Obama’s presidency. In September, after allegations of incidents affecting the health of its diplomats in Havana, the U. S. administration reduced its embassy to a skeleton staff, resulting in the suspension of almost all visa processing. “The Cuban delegation expressed deep concern over the negative impact that the unilateral, unfounded and politically motivated decisions adopted by the U. S. government . have on migration relations between both countries,” the Cuban foreign ministry said in a statement. The statement was issued after delegations led by Cuba’s Foreign Ministry chief for U. S. Affairs Josefina Vidal and U.
206	10	Arizona couldn’t defy the feds on immigration and neither can California: The United States is suing California over immigration. Six years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled for the federal government against a state government in an almost perfectly reverse-image case. Arizona had passed a state law in response to what Arizona thought was under-enforcement of the immigration laws by President Obama. California has passed state laws in response to too much enforcement of those laws by President Trump. Arizona had made the federal crime of illegal entry a state crime as well. To help enforce that law, the state ordered its sheriffs, police, and state troopers to inquire about immigration status whenever an individual was arrested for a non-immigration related crime. Arizona also made it a crime for someone illegally in our country to seek employment in Arizona. The state’s purpose was to dissuade illegal immigration. Arizona argued that its law did not contradict federal immigration law; indeed, it directly reinforced it. The Obama Administration responded that, nonetheless, it was the president’s prerogative to decide how vigorously to enforce the immigration laws. Arizona was upsetting the balance the federal government had chosen relative to immigration. It was lending its weight to the pro-enforcement side at a time when the president might have wanted to go light on enforcing this law.
45	6	Trump plan would sharply change legal immigration: President Donald Trump's new immigration plan is stirring up controversy with its proposals on legal immigration. Much of the public debate to this point has been about young immigrants brought to this country as children illegally. But the plan's potential impact on legal immigration has sparked fierce Democratic opposition and appears it may sink chances for a bipartisan deal in Congress. The proposal outlined Thursday by the White House would end much family-based immigration and the visa lottery program, moves that some experts estimate could cut legal immigration into the United States nearly in half. The plan would also protect some 700,000 young immigrants from deportation and provide a pathway to citizenship, a top Democratic goal.
28	2	Samantha Bee Slams ‘Feckless C**t’ Ivanka Trump For Not Doing Something About Immigration: Samantha Bee is outraged that U. S. immigration authorities are separating undocumented children and their parents at the border. “Tearing children away from their parents is so evil, it’s the inciting incident in almost every movie we’ve ever cared about,” Bee said in the latest episode of “Full Frontal. ” To make matters worse, the administration has lost track of hundreds of children who were separated from their parents and placed in foster care. Enter Ivanka Trump, who posted a photo of herself and her son on Twitter last Sunday. That “oblivious tweet” sparked this plea from Bee: “You know, Ivanka, that’s a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another, do something about your dad’s immigration practices, you feckless c**t! ” UPDATE: 2:26 p. m. ― Bee has since apologized for her remarks after receiving backlash from social media users, sponsors and even White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. In a statement to HuffPost, Bee said: “I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night. It was inappropriate and inexcusable.

The Valley Morning Star of Harlingen reports that Willacy County commissioners on Monday agreed to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center outside Raymondville, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border city of Brownsville. County Judge Aurelio Guerra says the new lockup will boost the local economy. The prison that housed 3,000 inmates in tent-like domes closed after the 2015 uprising. A county lawsuit blamed the riot on ""abysmal mismanagement"" by Utah-based Management & Training Corp. Management & Training, which bought the site last year, will operate the new immigrant facility."
438	4	How to cross the US-Mexico border: making El Mar La Mar: The Sonoran desert is a piece of the American landscape that has evolved as if to edit humanity out of existence. Populated by spiked plants, poisonous insects, rattlesnakes and America’s only native big cat, the jaguar, its arid terrain stretches along the US-Mexican border over a total of 260,000 sq km. Crossing this wildnerness on foot takes three to five days, and during the summer, daytime temperatures regularly exceed 40°C (104°F). The US border patrol is alleged to have retrieved 6,029 human remains from this stretch in southern Arizona since the 1990s. The bodies of thousands of others who have tried to enter the US through the desert may have been bleached away by the searing sun before they were found. For El Mar La Mar, which premiered at the Berlin film festival this week, film-makers Joshua Bonnetta and JP Sniadecki visited this hostile environment for lengthy spells over the course of almost three years, filming the landscape, recording wildlife and talking to border rangers, aid workers and people-smugglers. Though their project started more than a year before the American electorate was lured by the promise of a “great, great wall” on its southern border, the result is a nature-documentary-cum-film-poem that also works as a sarcastic riposte to the new president’s grand plan: how could anyone artificially design a more mercilessly efficient deathtrap than the Sonoran desert in its current form?

To film Human Flow, he spent extended periods inside refugee camps and at points of entry. Perhaps the most miserable was in the train station at Idomeni in northern Greece: When Macedonia closed its border to them, thousands of migrants trying to reach Germany got trapped for months in what was designed as only a transit camp. Amid the residents huddling in leaky pup tents, Ai met a young Syrian woman who recalled playing the piano before she fled continual bombardment in her homeland. He decided to get her one. ""All the stories in a refugee camp are so sad; nobody knows who you are,"" the artist said during an interview last month after attending the inaugural 6 Degrees conference in Toronto, where he received the Adrienne Clarkson Prize for Global Citizenship. ""I said: 'You have come from so far away. Here in Europe, pianos are plenty. So let's get you a piano. ' I am the son of a poet; I have romantic thinking.

205	5	Trump's asylum rule is already changing the border: On a gray morning, a group of Haitian migrants chatted idly on a quiet corner in downtown Tijuana, near the U.S. border, speaking French and eating Creole and exchanging cellphone chargers to use later in a nearby Starbucks. Among them was Rene Raphael, a 28-year-old former medical student. Like most of the roughly 4,000 Haitians now staying in shelters in Tijuana, Raphael has spent the past few years as a nomad. First, he fled Haiti, which suffered a devastating earthquake in 2010, for Brazil, where the country’s construction boom provided work. When Brazil’s economy cratered last year, Raphael and his pregnant wife made a harrowing, two-continent trek north to the U.S.-Mexico border. Their goal? Asylum. Their hurdle? The same executive order that calls for building a big border wall. Legal or loophole? Little noticed in his flurry of immigration-related executive orders, President Donald Trump has pushed to change the way the United States handles asylum, a designation sought by a growing number of migrants looking to enter the U.S. Traditionally, asylum is granted (or not) to people who fear persecution in their home country based on things like religion, nationality and politics.
8	8	"Majority of Americans support National Guard on border: (Reuters) - A majority of Americans think President Donald Trump’s plan to send National Guard troops to the U. S. -Mexico border will be effective in combating illegal immigration in the short term, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll from April 15-19. Here are some key findings from the poll: THINKING LONG TERM Fifty-five percent of U. S. adults think deploying the National Guard to the border will be effective in the short term, but only 49 percent think it will be effective in the long term. About 16 percent of Americans think it will be ""very effective"" short and long-term. PARTY LINES Seventy-seven percent of Republicans think deploying the National Guard will be effective in the short term, compared with just 42 percent of Democrats. A large majority of Trump voters - 85 percent - are confident in the plan in the short term. But people across both parties tend to be less sure it is a durable strategy, slipping to 73 percent for Republicans and 34 percent for Democrats. Fifteen percent of Trump voters also think it will be ineffective long-term. DEMOCRATS DIVIDED The poll shows Democrats are split over whether deploying the National Guard will curb illegal immigration."

Photo: AFP New Delhi: The Union home ministry in its 2016-17 annual report released on Wednesday has published an image of the Spain-Morocco border to illustrate floodlighting done along India’s borders in Jammu and Kashmir. Captioned “floodlighting along the border”, the picture showing a stretch along the Spain-Morocco border, has actually been taken from photo aggregator Pinterest. Despite repeated attempts to get a clarification on the matter, the home ministry declined to comment. Defence experts said such errors were best avoided. “This is a human error. But they need to be more careful about this in future,” said Gurmeet Kanwal, a defence expert at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. Floodlighting has been one of the major issues that have been discussed in the recent past as a weak point in India’s monitoring systems along the border—a factor that aids cross-border infiltration. The common thread linking recent terrorist attacks at Pathankot, Uri and Nagrota was the lack of lighting in the forest areas along the India-Pakistan border, allowing infiltrators to enter Indian territory.
159	10	Two migrant workers suffocate to death inside water board’s pipeline: By Express News Service HYDERABAD: Two migrant workers from Odisha died inside a water pipeline belonging to the HMWS&SB on Wednesday, while trying to remove the centring material put inside the inspection chamber. The workers, identified as Santosh (28) and Vijay (25), died within minutes of entering the pipeline in front the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium at Uppal. The duo, believed to have died of asphyxiation, was working on a contract basis with L&T. Accompanied by a supervisor and colleagues Mahesh and Muni, they went to the spot on Wednesday. The duo first opened the lid of another chamber, but could not enter due to the stink, hot air and gases emanating from it. They then managed to enter through another chamber. After breaking the centring, when Santosh moved ahead to open the valve for water supply he fell into the 3-metre deep chamber and became unconscious. Vijay who followed him also met with the same fate. All this while, the supervisor and Muni were waiting outside, while Mahesh had gone to fetch some drinking water. It was much later that they noticed their colleagues had collapsed inside the chamber. They were pulled out with the help of passersby, but were dead by then.

Immigrants and civil-rights attorneys have filed a petition in federal court in Seattle seeking the release of a 23-year-old Mexican immigrant brought illegally into the U.

The agents were conducting an action at his father’s house, and Medina was detained, according to the news service Reuters and a news release by the attorneys in his case. ICE countered in a statement Tuesday that Medina — whom they identify as “Mr. Ramirez” — was a “self-admitted gang member” encountered during the arrest of a felon previously deported. He is in custody at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma “to await the outcome of removal proceedings,” said ICE Northwest spokeswoman Rose Richeson. “ICE officers took Mr.

In a series of blogs this week he will be talking us through his journey from Syria to Greece and the difficulties he faced along the way. You can find the first blog here. I will never forget the name of Moria. When we arrived at that camp, we asked for a wheelchair, but nobody helped us or even told us what to do. They put us in a place that looked like a lock-up. A while later I had time to see that the refugee camp consisted of three main parts: the upper, which was for families; the second part, which was divided in three sections: section A for special cases, section B for minors, and section C for single women and their children; and the third part, which was for men. I spent my first week there, in that kind of lock-up. During that period, I had to finish my registration papers but I didn’t have my wheelchair to move from place to place, so my nephew carried me on his back. We went to many offices and asked many organisations about my wheelchair but there was no answer.
232	6	Pipelines, asylum seekers, tuberculosis: how politics touched us this week: OTTAWA — Parliament Hill was a swirl of fresh faces and a storm of news this week in the rush to get things done and square events away before the Thanksgiving break. In a sea of pageantry, the next Governor General, astronaut Julie Payette, was sworn in to her new position, replacing David Johnston. Premiers and Indigenous leaders from across the country then gathered nearby for a meeting with the prime minister — a meeting that led to a more solid picture of what legalization of cannabis will eventually look like. The next day, the NDP's new leader, Jagmeet Singh, took a victory lap through his party's caucus room, inspiring a jubilance not seen since the days of Jack Layton. Personalities aside, there were impactful developments on pipelines, asylum seekers and tuberculosis. Here's how politics affected Canadians' everyday lives this week: PIPELINE APOPLEXY TransCanada has followed through on its hints this summer and cancelled its $16-billion plans for the Energy East pipeline — an announcement that prompted a vicious round of finger-pointing, blame-casting and, in some corners, celebration. Whether the cancellation was because of market forces (as the Liberals contend) or unreasonable public policy (as the Conservatives argue), environmental activists and the mayor of Montreal claimed victory.
229	7	The Cost and Benefits of Family-Based Immigration in Ohio: The issue of immigration reform may have been swept from the headlines in the past couple weeks, but it hasn’t left the minds of many immigrants. Local immigration attorneys say they’ve been getting worried calls from clients ever since the President proposed eliminating some categories of family-based visas. “Most immigration attorneys would tell you that they are seeing a trend of people worried,” said immigration lawyer Melissa Gawelek, “especially people who are living thousands of miles away from their loved ones.” 'Grandma and Grandpa probably aren't paying enough in taxes to cover their consumption of public services.' Merit system During his State of the Union speech, Trump called for an end to a decades-old federal law that allows U.S. citizens to sponsor their relatives and siblings for a green card—a system that Trump and many Republicans have referred to as “chain migration,” while many Democrats are calling it “family reunification.” In addition to curbing family-based immigration, Trump advocated shifting visa criteria towards a points-based “merit” system that would, among other factors, favor foreign nationals with advanced degrees and English proficiency. Trump says the changes would be good for the most vulnerable American workers and boost the economy—but how exactly does family-based immigration impact the economy?

Jonathan Powell said Theresa May has committed “the worst possible sin a negotiator can commit” – having “boxed herself in”, in an article for The Independent. It comes as the EU and the UK said no agreement had been reached on the approach to avoid a hard border on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Mr Powell the Government’s proposal of enjoying “the benefits of the single market in the areas we choose without taking on the obligations it requires” is at the centre of the problem. Tony Blair’s former chief of staff warned that a return to “huge concrete slabs” and “checkpoints on the main roads” could “force Northern Ireland back into identity politics”. The former diplomat wrote: “She will be faced by the alternative of accepting the current EU draft and losing the support of the 10 DUP MPs who sustain her Government, or alternatively accepting that the whole of the UK remains in the single market and the customs union, in which case she will lose the support of the 62 backbench Brexit Tories.

A local immigration official is praising Saanich’s decision to call on the federal government to improve processing time for refugee applications. “I’m obviously pleased that Saanich sees this as an important issue,” said Sabine Lehr, private sponsorship of refugees manager, for the Intercultural Association of Victoria. Lehr was one of several voices Monday who spoke in favour of the motion from Coun. Fred Haynes. It directs Saanich staff to send letters to the office of the Prime Minister, the federal minister of immigration, and local Members of Parliament requesting that Ottawa “looks to further improve both the processing time and the numbers for both Private Sponsored and Government Assisted refugees. ” According to various sources, including Lehr, some 40,000 private sponsorship applications await processing, and the federal government announced earlier measures to improve processing times. While Haynes acknowledged those efforts, he said more needs to be done. “It’s always good to push on a door that is already opening for you,” he said. “It’s better than pushing on a door that is closed and will not open for you.

Picture taken January 19, 2017. To match Insight EUROPE-MIGRANTS/RAQQA REUTERS/Yves Herman Refugees have bureaucratic problems when they try to come to Europe. But once people are granted protection, they are entitled to bring in their families. Reuters found that despite having a legal right to be reunited, these families remain separated, often in the case of Syrians fleeing Islamic State because they need to produce documents they can only get from the Assad administration. Reporter Shadia Nasralla, who is based in Vienna, examined this problem for the first time. In the absence of reliable central data, she collated whatever statistics about families in limbo she could find. Nasralla determined that tens of thousands of families are affected by stipulations by European nations requiring Syrians to provide highly specific documents. For instance, she found that often governments require those documents to be certified by Damascus. As a result, the price of Syrian passports has rocketed. A defining moment came months into Nasralla's investigation, after she had consistently been told that no centrally collated figures were available.
119	5	South Africa: Refugees Struggle to Renew Papers At Home Affairs: Asylum seekers from Somalia face unexplained delays and shabby treatment at the foreshore office A number of refugees from Somalia say they keep getting turned away at the Customs House foreshore offices of Home Affairs when trying to renew their documents. This after they had travelled all the way from Pretoria, since Home Affairs only allows people to renew their documents at the place they first applied for refugee status in South Africa. Last week, GroundUp met Abdullahi Mumin and a group of Somalis outside the Home Affairs offices. Mumin received refugee status in 2007 and renews every four years. He said this time it was their fourth visit in a month, trying to renew his documents. He had been to the offices on 1 May, told to return on 25 May, which he did, only to be told to return on 1 June, only to be told yet again to return on 9 June. On 9 June, he was told to return on 13 June. Each time officials would scribble the return date on the permit. Mumin now plans to engage a lawyer. Mumin has a shop to run in Pretoria and the trips to Cape Town cost him business.

207	7	2 wrongfully convicted immigrants face uncertain future - WAFB 9 News Baton Rouge, Louisiana News, Weather, Sports: CHICAGO (AP) - Freedom was short-lived for two Mexican immigrants recently released after nearly 20 years in an Illinois prison when a judge ruled their confessions in a gruesome double-murder case were likely coerced. Gabriel Solache and Arturo DeLeon-Reyes, who were freed in December, were immediately detained again. This time they're awaiting deportation proceedings from Immigration and Customs Enforcement because they entered the country illegally. They are among several defendants who have walked free because their cases were handled by Reynaldo Guevara, a discredited former Chicago detective facing allegations that for years he beat and bullied defendants to obtain false confessions.
