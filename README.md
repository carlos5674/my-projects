# Carlos Gomez – CS Project Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases a curated collection of projects I've built to explore foundational concepts in computer science and software engineering. These span machine learning, systems design, web security, web development, data visualization, and more.

Each project includes a detailed README and is structured to demonstrate practical implementations, algorithmic thinking, and design clarity.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🧠 [Machine Learning](Machinelearning/)
A PyTorch-based collection of classification models including perceptron, linear models, and MLPs. Features training logic, visualizations, and modular design patterns.

### 🐍 [MealMates App](MealMates/)
A React + Vite web app designed to help roommates plan meals, coordinate grocery shopping, and rotate cooking responsibilities. Built with a component-driven frontend architecture using Tailwind CSS.

### 🏗️ [Modular CPU in Logisim](Modular_CPU_Logisim/)
A fully modular, single-cycle processor built in Logisim Evolution. Implements ALU, control logic, registers, and memory. Validated using scripted test harnesses.

### 🌍 [Procedural World Generation in Java](Procedural_World_Generation_Java/)
Randomly generates room and hallway layouts on a tile map in Java. Real-time rendering with extensible components and grid-based geometry logic.

### 🔐 [Secure File Sharing System in Go](Secure_File_Sharing_System_Go/)
Secure file storage and sharing system in Go using AES, HMAC, and public-key cryptography. Supports encrypted sharing, revocation, and data integrity.
